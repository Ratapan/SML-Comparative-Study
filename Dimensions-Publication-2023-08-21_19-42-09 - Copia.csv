One of the significant drawbacks of e-learning in comparison to the traditional classroom is that teachers cannot monitor the students' attentiveness. Previous literature used physical facial features or emotional states in detecting attentiveness. Other studies proposed combining physical and emotional facial features; however, a mixed model that only used a webcam was not tested. The study objective is to develop a machine learning (ML) model that automatically estimates students' attentiveness during e-learning classes using only a webcam. The model would help in evaluating teaching methods for e-learning. This study collected videos from seven students. The webcam of personal computers is used to obtain a video, from which we build a feature set that characterizes a student's physical and emotional state based on their face. This characterization includes eye aspect ratio (EAR), Yawn aspect ratio (YAR), head pose, and emotional states.A total of eleven variables are used in the training and validation of the model. ML algorithms are used to estimate individual students' attention levels. The ML models tested are decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Human observers' estimation of attention level is used as a reference. Our best attention classifier is the XGBoost, which achieved an average accuracy of 80.52%, with an AUROC OVR of 92.12%. The results indicate that a combination of emotional and non-emotional measures can generate a classifier with an accuracy comparable to other attentiveness studies. The study would also help assess the e-learning lectures through students' attentiveness. Hence will assist in developing the e-learning lectures by generating an attentiveness report for the tested lecture.",,"Open access funding provided by FCT|FCCN (b-on).

We calculated the contribution of influencing factors in the model by using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm and sHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, and get the following findings: (1) Factors that have the greatest impact on students' reading literacy are from individual and family levels, with school-level factors taking a relative back seat. (2) The most important influencing factors at individual level are reading metacognition and reading interest. (3) The most important factors at family level are ESCS (index of economic, social and cultural status) and language environment, and dialect is negative for reading literacy, whereas proficiency in both a dialect and Mandarin plays a positive role. (4) At the school level, the most important factors are time dedicated to learning and class discipline, and we found that there is an optimal value for learning time, which suggests that reasonable learning time is beneficial, but overextended learning time may make academic performance worse instead of improving it.",,This work was supported in part by the National Social Science Fund of China under Grant 20CTJ019.,Frontiers in Psychology,,,,2022-09-23,2022,2022-09-23,,13,,948612,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liu, Hao; Chen, Xi; Liu, Xiaoxiao","Liu, Hao (Collaborative Innovation Centre for Assessment of Basic Education Quality, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Chen, Xi (Collaborative Innovation Centre for Assessment of Basic Education Quality, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China); Liu, Xiaoxiao (Institute of Education, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada)","Liu, Hao (Beijing Normal University)","Liu, Hao (Beijing Normal University); Chen, Xi (Beijing Normal University); Liu, Xiaoxiao (University of Alberta)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.948612/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151263449,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,4 Quality Education

Thus, identifying relevant risk factors and predicting RSB are important to intervene and prevent RSB among college students.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to establish a predictive model for RSB among college students to facilitate timely intervention and the prevention of RSB to help limit STI contraction.
METHODS: We included a total of 8794 heterosexual Chinese students who self-reported engaging in sexual intercourse from November 2019 to February 2020. We identified RSB among those students and attributed it to 4 dimensions: whether contraception was used, whether the contraceptive method was safe, whether students engaged in casual sex or sex with multiple partners, and integrated RSB (which combined the first 3 dimensions). Overall, 126 predictors were included in this study, including demographic characteristics, daily habits, physical and mental health, relationship status, sexual knowledge, sexual education, sexual attitude, and previous sexual experience. For each type of RSB, we compared 8 machine learning (ML) models: multiple logistic regression (MLR), naive Bayes (BYS), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), deep learning (DL), and the ensemble model. The optimal model for both RSB prediction and risk factor identification was selected based on a set of validation indicators. An MLR model was applied to investigate the association between RSB and identified risk factors through ML methods.
RESULTS: In total, 5328 (60.59%) students were found to have previously engaged in RSB. Among them, 3682 (41.87%) did not use contraception every time they had sexual intercourse, 3602 (40.96%) had previously used an ineffective or unsafe contraceptive method, and 1157 (13.16%) had engaged in casual sex or sex with multiple partners. XGBoost achieved the optimal predictive performance on all 4 types of RSB, with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) reaching 0.78, 0.72, 0.94, and 0.80 for contraceptive use, safe contraceptive method use, engagement in casual sex or with multiple partners, and integrated RSB, respectively. By ensuring the stability of various validation indicators, the 12 most predictive variables were then selected using XGBoost, including the participants' relationship status, sexual knowledge, sexual attitude, and previous sexual experience. Through MLR, RSB was found to be significantly associated with less sexual knowledge, more liberal sexual attitudes, single relationship status, and increased sexual experience.
CONCLUSIONS: RSB is prevalent among college students. The XGBoost model is an effective approach to predict RSB and identify corresponding risk factors. This study presented an opportunity to promote sexual and reproductive health through ML models, which can help targeted interventions aimed at different subgroups and the precise surveillance and prevention of RSB among college students through risk probability prediction.",The authors would like to express gratitude to the China Family Planning Association and the China Youth Network for their support in data collection and to all the students who participated in this survey.,,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,,Gunther Eysenbach,Humans; Cross-Sectional Studies; Universities; Bayes Theorem; Sexual Behavior; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Students,2023-01-25,2023,2023-01-25,,9,,e41162,All OA; Gold,Article,"Li, Xuan; Zhang, Hanxiyue; Zhao, Shuangyu; Tang, Kun","Li, Xuan (Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China); Zhang, Hanxiyue (Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China); Zhao, Shuangyu (Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China); Tang, Kun (Vanke School of Public Health, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China)","Tang, Kun (Tsinghua University)","Li, Xuan (Tsinghua University); Zhang, Hanxiyue (Tsinghua University); Zhao, Shuangyu (Tsinghua University); Tang, Kun (Tsinghua University)",0,0,,,https://jmir.org/api/download?alt_name=publichealth_v9i1e41162_app1.pdf&filename=dce381c9b65ff148baf698ba5601b3a0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153257814,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

A 1-year prospective cohort study,"PurposeThis study aimed to develop an interpretable machine learning model to predict the onset of myopia based on individual daily information.MethodThis study was a prospective cohort study. At baseline, non-myopia children aged 6–13 years old were recruited, and individual data were collected through interviewing students and parents. One year after baseline, the incidence of myopia was evaluated based on visual acuity test and cycloplegic refraction measurement. Five algorithms, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, CatBoost and Logistic Regression were utilized to develop different models and their performance was validated by area under curve (AUC). Shapley Additive exPlanations was applied to interpret the model output on the individual and global level.ResultOf 2221 children, 260 (11.7%) developed myopia in 1 year. In univariable analysis, 26 features were associated with the myopia incidence. Catboost algorithm had the highest AUC of 0.951 in the model validation. The top 3 features for predicting myopia were parental myopia, grade and frequency of eye fatigue. A compact model using only 10 features was validated with an AUC of 0.891.ConclusionThe daily information contributed reliable predictors for childhood’s myopia onset. The interpretable Catboost model presented the best prediction performance. Oversampling technology greatly improved model performance. This model could be a tool in myopia preventing and intervention that can help identify children who are at risk of myopia, and provide personalized prevention strategies based on contributions of risk factors to the individual prediction result.","The authors thank Anhui Owl Technology Co., Ltd for assistance with data collection and Hefei Institutes of Physical Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, for project implementation support and management.

Still, at present, there are no drug therapies that can properly cure this deadly disease. However, early-stage detection could boost the life expectancy of the patients. The main aim of this work is to apply machine learning models along with statistical methods to the clinical data obtained from 349 patient individuals to conduct predictive analytics for early diagnosis. In statistical analysis, Student's t-test as well as log fold changes of two groups are used to find the significant blood biomarkers. Furthermore, a set of machine learning models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost), Logistic Regression (LR), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) are used to build classification models to stratify benign-vs.-malignant ovarian cancer patients. Both of the analysis techniques recognized that the serumsamples carbohydrate antigen 125, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen and human epididymis protein 4 are the top-most significant biomarkers as well as neutrophil ratio, thrombocytocrit, hematocrit blood samples, alanine aminotransferase, calcium, indirect bilirubin, uric acid, natriumas as general chemistry tests. Moreover, the results from predictive analysis suggest that the machine learning models can classify malignant patients from benign patients with accuracy as good as 91%. Since generally, early-stage detection is not available, machine learning detection could play a significant role in cancer diagnosis.",,The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University for funding this work through Research Group no.

Students receive feedback on their knowledge (development) mostly in comparison to their own cohort. In this study, we use the data of the PTM to find groups with similar response patterns.MethodsWe performed k-means clustering with a dataset of 5,444 students, selected cluster number k = 5, and answers as features. Subsequently, the data was passed to XGBoost with the cluster assignment as target enabling the identification of cluster-relevant questions for each cluster with SHAP. Clusters were examined by total scores, response patterns, and confidence level. Relevant questions were evaluated for difficulty index, discriminatory index, and competence levels.ResultsThree of the five clusters can be seen as “performance” clusters: cluster 0 (n = 761) consisted predominantly of students close to graduation. Relevant questions tend to be difficult, but students answered confidently and correctly. Students in cluster 1 (n = 1,357) were advanced, cluster 3 (n = 1,453) consisted mainly of beginners. Relevant questions for these clusters were rather easy. The number of guessed answers increased. There were two “drop-out” clusters: students in cluster 2 (n = 384) dropped out of the test about halfway through after initially performing well; cluster 4 (n = 1,489) included students from the first semesters as well as “non-serious” students both with mostly incorrect guesses or no answers.ConclusionClusters placed performance in the context of participating universities. Relevant questions served as good cluster separators and further supported our “performance” cluster groupings.",We would like to thank Jochen Kruppa for his feedback and the support in this project.,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

In this work, it firstly clarifies the teaching requirements of college English classrooms and expounds the principles and advantages of machine learning technology. Secondly, a three-layer neural network model (NNM) is constructed by using the multilayer perceptron (MLP), combined with the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm. Furthermore, three semantic representation vector technologies, including word vector, paragraph vector, and full-text vector feature, are used to represent the full-text vocabulary of English composition. Then, a model based on the K-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is proposed to generate English composition evaluation, and a final score based on the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model is proposed. Finally, a model dataset is constructed using 800 college students' English essays for the CET-4 mock test, and the model is tested. The research results show that the semantic representation vector technology proposed can more effectively extract the lexical semantic features of English compositions. The XGBoost model and the kNN algorithm model are used to score and evaluate English compositions, which improves the accuracy of the scores. This makes the management of the entire scoring model more efficient and more accurate. It means that the model proposed is better than the traditional model in terms of evaluation accuracy.

However, there is no concordant standard for such calls.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict students' mental health problems in 1 year and the following year using the health survey's content and answering time (response time, response time stamp, and answer date).
METHODS: Data were obtained from the responses of 3561 (62.58%) of 5690 undergraduate students from University A in Japan (a national university) who completed the health survey in 2020 and 2021. We performed 2 analyses; in analysis 1, a mental health problem in 2020 was predicted from demographics, answers for the health survey, and answering time in the same year, and in analysis 2, a mental health problem in 2021 was predicted from the same input variables as in analysis 1. We compared the results from different ML models, such as logistic regression, elastic net, random forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The results with and without answering time conditions were compared using the adopted model.
RESULTS: On the basis of the comparison of the models, we adopted the LightGBM model. In this model, both analyses and conditions achieved adequate performance (eg, Matthews correlation coefficient [MCC] of with answering time condition in analysis 1 was 0.970 and MCC of without answering time condition in analysis 1 was 0.976; MCC of with answering time condition in analysis 2 was 0.986 and that of without answering time condition in analysis 2 was 0.971). In both analyses and in both conditions, the response to the questions about campus life (eg, anxiety and future) had the highest impact (Gain 0.131-0.216; Shapley additive explanations 0.018-0.028). Shapley additive explanations of 5 to 6 input variables from questions about campus life were included in the top 10. In contrast to our expectation, the inclusion of answering time-related variables did not exhibit substantial improvement in the prediction of students' mental health problems. However, certain variables generated based on the answering time are apparently helpful in improving the prediction and affecting the prediction probability.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the possibility of predicting mental health across years using health survey data.

However, P2P lending platforms are not tightly governed by relevant laws yet, as their development speed has far exceeded that of regulations. Therefore, P2P lending operations are still subject to risks. This paper proposes prediction models to mitigate the risks of default and asymmetric information on P2P lending platforms. Specifically, we designed sophisticated procedures to pre-process mass data extracted from Lending Club in 2018 Q3-2019 Q2. After that, three statistical models, namely, Logistic Regression, Bayesian Classifier, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and five AI models, namely, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LightGBM, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were utilized for data analysis. The loan statuses of Lending Club's customers were rationally classified. To evaluate the models, we adopted the confusion matrix series of metrics, AUC-ROC curve, Kolmogorov-Smirnov chart (KS), and Student's t-test. Empirical studies show that LightGBM produces the best performance and is 2.91% more accurate than the other models, resulting in a revenue improvement of nearly USD 24 million for Lending Club. Student's t-test proves that the differences between models are statistically significant.",,This research received no external funding.,Entropy,,"Andrea Prati, Luis Javier García Villalba, Vincent A.

Alpha diversity analysis was performed on fecal samples to assess the diversity and abundance of flora. The RDP classifier Bayesian algorithm was used to analyze the community structure. Linear discriminant analysis and Student's t test were used to screen the differences in flora. The PICRUSt1 method was used to predict the bacterial function, and six machine learning models, including logistic regression, random forest, neural network, support vector machine, CatBoost and gradient boosting decision tree, were used to construct a prediction model for the poor differentiation of colorectal cancer.ResultsThere was no significant difference in fecal flora alpha diversity between moderately and poorly differentiated colorectal cancer (P > 0.05). The bacteria that accounted for a large proportion of patients with poorly differentiated and moderately differentiated colorectal cancer were Blautia, Escherichia-Shigella, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bacteroides. At the genus level, there were nine bacteria with high abundance in the poorly differentiated group, including Bifidobacterium, norank_f__Oscillospiraceae, Eisenbergiella, etc. There were six bacteria with high abundance in the moderately differentiated group, including Megamonas, Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003, Actinomyces, etc. The RF model had the highest prediction accuracy (100.00% correct). The bacteria that had the greatest variable importance in the model were Pseudoramibacter, Megamonas and Bifidobacterium.ConclusionThe degree of pathological differentiation of colorectal cancer was related to gut flora, and poorly differentiated colorectal cancer had some different bacterial flora, and intestinal bacteria can be used as biomarkers for predicting poorly differentiated CRC.",The authors gratefully acknowledge the database available to us for this study.

Currently, scoring systems are widely applied for mortality prediction, while the performance is unsatisfactory in many clinical conditions due to the non-specificity and linearity characteristics of the used model. As the availability of the large volume of data recorded in electronic health records (EHRs), deep learning models have achieved state-of-art predictive performance. However, deep learning models are hard to meet the requirement of explainability in clinical conditions. Hence, an explainable Knowledge Distillation method with XGBoost (XGB-KD) is proposed to improve the predictive performance of XGBoost while supporting better explainability.
METHODS: In this method, we first use outperformed deep learning teacher models to learn the complex patterns hidden in high-dimensional multivariate time series data. Then, we distill knowledge from soft labels generated by the ensemble of teacher models to guide the training of XGBoost student model, whose inputs are meaningful features obtained from feature engineering. Finally, we conduct model calibration to obtain predicted probabilities reflecting the true posterior probabilities and use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to obtain insights about the trained model.
RESULTS: We conduct comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-III dataset to evaluate our method. The results demonstrate that our method achieves better predictive performance than vanilla XGBoost, deep learning models and several state-of-art baselines from related works. Our method can also provide intuitive explanations.
CONCLUSIONS: Our method is useful for improving the predictive performance of XGBoost by distilling knowledge from deep learning models and can provide meaningful explanations for predictions.","This research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71771034), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China (No. DUT21YG108), and the Dalian High Level Talents Innovation Support Plan, China (2021RD01).

The dataset presents many challenges, the most important of which is many missing data as well as the being heavily unbalanced (there are few severe mood disorder cases). We find that all algorithms are specific, but only the rpart algorithm is sensitive; i.e., it is able to detect cases of real cases mood disorder. The conclusion of this paper is that this is caused by the fact that the rpart algorithm uses the surrogate variables to handle missing data. The most important social-studies-related result is that the adolescents' relationships with their parents are the single most important factor in developing mood disorders-far more important than other factors, such as the socio-economic status or school success.",,This research received no external funding.,Entropy,,Zoran H.

METHODS: Teeth receiving RCT at one university clinic from 2016-2020 with complete documentation were included. Successful RFL was defined to be 0-2mm of the apex, suboptimal RFL >2mm or beyond the apex. Logistic regression (logR) was used for association analyses; logR and more advanced machine learning (random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)) were employed for predictive modeling.
RESULTS: 555 completed RCT (343 patients, female/male 32.1/67.9%) were included. In our association analysis (involving the full dataset), unsuccessful RFL was more likely in undergraduate students (US): OR 2.74, 95% CI [1.61, 4.75], p < 0.001), teeth with indistinct canal paths (OR 11.04, [2.87, 44.88], p < 0.001), root canals reduced in size (OR 2.56, [1.49, 4.46], p < 0.01), retreatments (OR 3.13, [1.6, 6.41], p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that dentists were more successful in mitigating risks than undergraduate students. Prediction of RFL on a separate testset was limitedly possible regardless of the machine learning approach.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving RFL is depending on the operator and several risk factors. The predictive performance on the technical outcome of a root canal treatment utilizing ML algorithms was insufficient.

We aimed to explore the prevalence rate of probable anxiety and probable insomnia and to find the risk factors among a longitudinal study of undergraduate students using the approach of machine learning.
METHODS: The baseline data (T1) were collected from freshmen who underwent psychological evaluation at two months after entering the university. At T2 stage (February 10th to 13th, 2020), we used a convenience cluster sampling to assess psychological state (probable anxiety was assessed by general anxiety disorder-7 and probable insomnia was assessed by insomnia severity index-7) based on a web survey. We integrated information attained at T1 stage to predict probable anxiety and probable insomnia at T2 stage using a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost).
RESULTS: Finally, we included 2009 students (response rate: 80.36%). The prevalence rate of probable anxiety and probable insomnia was 12.49% and 16.87%, respectively. The XGBoost algorithm predicted 1954 out of 2009 students (translated into 97.3% accuracy) and 1932 out of 2009 students (translated into 96.2% accuracy) who suffered anxiety and insomnia symptoms, respectively. The most relevant variables in predicting probable anxiety included romantic relationship, suicidal ideation, sleep symptoms, and a history of anxiety symptoms. The most relevant variables in predicting probable insomnia included aggression, psychotic experiences, suicidal ideation, and romantic relationship.
CONCLUSION: Risks for probable anxiety and probable insomnia among undergraduate students can be identified at an individual level by baseline data.

This article aims to investigate the change of anxiety severity and prevalence among non-graduating undergraduate students in the new semester of online learning during COVID-19 in China and also to evaluate a machine learning model based on the XGBoost model. A total of 1172 non-graduating undergraduate students aged between 18 and 22 from 34 provincial-level administrative units and 260 cities in China were enrolled onto this study and asked to fill in a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) twice, respectively, during February 15 to 17, 2020, before the new semester started, and March 15 to 17, 2020, 1 month after the new semester based on online learning had started. SPSS 22.0 was used to conduct t-test and single factor analysis. XGBoost models were implemented to predict the anxiety level of students 1 month after the start of the new semester. There were 184 (15.7%, Mean = 58.45, SD = 7.81) and 221 (18.86%, Mean = 57.68, SD = 7.58) students who met the cut-off of 50 and were screened as positive for anxiety, respectively, in the two investigations. The mean SAS scores in the second test was significantly higher than those in the first test (P < 0.05). Significant differences were also found among all males, females, and students majoring in arts and sciences between the two studies (P < 0.05). The results also showed students from Hubei province, where most cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, had a higher percentage of participants meeting the cut-off of being anxious. This article applied machine learning to establish XGBoost models to successfully predict the anxiety level and changes of anxiety levels 4 weeks later based on the SAS scores of the students in the first test. It was concluded that, during COVID-19, Chinese non-graduating undergraduate students showed higher anxiety in the new semester based on online learning than before the new semester started. More students from Hubei province had a different level of anxiety than other provinces. Families, universities, and society as a whole should pay attention to the psychological health of non-graduating undergraduate students and take measures accordingly.

Material and methods: Prediction of students' status and score on high-stakes examinations faces several challenges, including an imbalanced number of failing and passing students, a large number of heterogeneous and complex features, and the need to identify at-risk and top-performing students. In this study, two major categories of ML approaches are compared: first, classic models (logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN)), and second, ensemble models (voting, bagging (BG), random forests (RF), adaptive boosting (ADA), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and stacking).
Results: To evaluate the models' discrimination ability, they are assessed using a real dataset containing information on medical students over a five-year period (n = 1005). The findings indicate that ensemble ML models demonstrate optimal performance in predicting CMBSE status (RF and stacking). Similarly, among the classic regressors, LR exhibited the highest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) (0.134) and coefficient of determination (R2) (0.62), whereas the RF model had the highest RMSD (0.077) and R2 (0.80) overall. Furthermore, Anatomical Sciences, Biochemistry, Parasitology, and Entomology grade point average (GPA) and grades demonstrated the strongest positive correlation with the outcomes.
Conclusion: Comparing classic and ensemble ML models revealed that ensemble models are superior to classic models. Therefore, the presented framework could be considered a suitable alternative for the CMBSE and other comparable medical licensing examinations.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Haniye Mastour reports was provided by National Agency for Strategic Research in Medical Education (NASR) Grant Number 994079 awarded.

Every day a tremendous amount of data is generated when students interact with VLEs to perform different activities and access learning material. To make the generated data useful, it must be processed and managed by the proper machine learning (ML) algorithm. ML algorithms' applications are many folds with Education Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) as their major fields. ML algorithms are commonly used to process raw data to discover hidden patterns and construct a model to make future predictions, such as predicting students' performance, dropouts, engagement, etc. However, in VLE, it is important to select the right and most applicable ML algorithm to give the best performance results. In this study, we aim to improve those ML and DL algorithms' performance that give an inferior performance in terms of performance, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Several ML algorithms were applied on Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset to reveal which one offers the best results in terms of performance, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Two popular ML algorithms called Decision Tree (DT) and Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) provided unsatisfactory results. They were selected and experimented with various techniques such as grid search cross-validation, adaptive boosting, extreme gradient boosting, early stopping, feature engineering, and dropping inactive neurons to improve their performance scores. Moreover, we also determined the feature weights/importance in predicting the students' study performance, leading to the design and development of the adaptive learning system. The ML techniques and the methods used in this research study can be used by instructors/administrators to optimize learning content and provide informed guidance to students, thus improving their learning experience and making it exciting and adaptive.",,The authors received no funding for this work.,PeerJ Computer Science,,Vimal Shanmuganathan,,2022-02-21,2022,2022-02-21,,8,,e803,All OA; Gold,Article,"Adnan, Muhammad; Alarood, Alaa Abdul Salam; Uddin, M.

Machine learning algorithms are known for their lack of interpretability compared with statistics. Given their high predictive precision, improving the interpretability of these algorithms can help increase their applicability and replicability in health educational research and applied linguistics, as well as in the development and review of new health education resources for effective and accessible health education.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to develop a linguistically enriched machine learning model to predict binary outcomes of online English health educational resources in terms of their easiness and complexity for international tertiary students.
METHODS: Logistic regression emerged as the best performing algorithm compared with support vector machine (SVM) (linear), SVM (radial basis function), random forest, and extreme gradient boosting on the transformed data set using L2 normalization. We applied recursive feature elimination with SVM to perform automatic feature selection. The automatically selected features (n=67) were then further streamlined through expert review. The finalized feature set of 22 semantic features achieved a similar area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with the initial (n=115) and automatically selected feature sets (n=67). Logistic regression with the linguistically enhanced feature set (n=22) exhibited important stability and robustness on the training data of different sizes (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%), and showed consistently high performance when compared with the other 4 algorithms (SVM [linear], SVM [radial basis function], random forest, and extreme gradient boosting).
RESULTS: We identified semantic features (with positive regression coefficients) contributing to the prediction of easy-to-understand online health texts and semantic features (with negative regression coefficients) contributing to the prediction of hard-to-understand health materials for readers with nonnative English backgrounds. Language complexity was explained by lexical difficulty (rarity and medical terminology), verbs typical of medical discourse, and syntactic complexity. Language easiness of online health materials was associated with features such as common speech act verbs, personal pronouns, and familiar reasoning verbs. Successive permutation of features illustrated the interaction between these features and their impact on key performance indicators of the machine learning algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: The new logistic regression model developed exhibited consistency, scalability, and, more importantly, interpretability based on existing health and linguistic research. It was found that low and high linguistic accessibilities of online health materials were explained by 2 sets of distinct semantic features. This revealed the inherent complexity of effective health communication beyond current readability analyses, which were limited to syntactic complexity and lexical difficulty.",,,JMIR Medical Informatics,,Gunther Eysenbach,,2021-10-26,2021,2021-10-26,,9,10,e25110,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xie, Wenxiu; Ji, Christine; Hao, Tianyong; Chow, Chi-Yin","Xie, Wenxiu (Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Ji, Christine (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia); Hao, Tianyong (School of Computer Science, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China); Chow, Chi-Yin (Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong)","Ji, Christine (The University of Sydney)","Xie, Wenxiu (City University of Hong Kong); Ji, Christine (The University of Sydney); Hao, Tianyong (South China Normal University); Chow, Chi-Yin (City University of Hong Kong)",1,1,0.49,0.66,https://medinform.jmir.org/2021/10/e25110/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141222551,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

In absence of a reliable credit evaluation system for students, the university students have to only apply through online peer-to-peer (P2P) loan platforms because Chinese financial institutions typically reject students' loan applications. Lack of students' financial records hinders financial institutes and banks to routinely evaluate the students' credit status and assign loans to them. Hence, this paper attempted to benefit from university students' diversified daily behavior data, and logistic regression (LR) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithms were also used to develop robust credit evaluation models for university students, in which the validation of the proposed models was assessed by a real-time P2P lending platform. In this study, the students' overdue behavior in returning books to university library was used as an index. With training 17838 samples, the proposed models performed well, while GBDT-based model outperformed in identification of ""bad borrowers."" Based on the proposed models, a self-sponsored peer-to-peer loan platform was established and developed in a Chinese university for ten months, and the achieved findings demonstrated that adopting such credit evaluation models can effectively reduce the default ratio.",This research was partly supported by the National Natural Science Fund of China (no. 71540022).,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,,Algorithms; Asian People; Behavior; Big Data; Humans; Machine Learning; Peer Group; Students,2019-04-16,2019,2019-04-16,2019-04-16,2019,,9898251,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hou, Yujiao; Ma, Xiaofeng; Mei, Guang; Wang, Ning; Xu, Weisheng","Hou, Yujiao (College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, Shanghai, China); Ma, Xiaofeng (College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, Shanghai, China); Mei, Guang (College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, Shanghai, China); Wang, Ning (College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, Shanghai, China); Xu, Weisheng (College of Electronics and Information Engineering, Tongji University Shanghai, Shanghai, China)","Xu, Weisheng (Tongji University)","Hou, Yujiao (Tongji University); Ma, Xiaofeng (Tongji University); Mei, Guang (Tongji University); Wang, Ning (Tongji University); Xu, Weisheng (Tongji University)",5,1,0.39,2.84,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2019/9898251.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113507944,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

The Danish telecommunication industry is experiencing a saturated market regarding the number of customers, but the number of service providers has increased significantly in recent years. Due to the high costs of acquiring new customers, the telecommunication industry put great emphasis on retaining customers in such an intensely competitive industry. We employ five machine learning algorithms: random forest, AdaBoost, logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting classifier, and decision tree classifier on four datasets from two geographical regions, Denmark and the USA. The first three datasets are from online repositories, and the last one contains responses from 311 students from Aalborg University collected through a survey. We identify key features extracted by the best-performing algorithms based on five performance measures. Based on that, we aggregate all the features that appear important for each dataset. The results demonstrate that customers’ preferences are not aligned. Among the prominent drivers, we find that service quality, customer satisfaction, offering subscription plan upgrades, and network coverage are unique to the Danish student population.

We named this mechanism Packets-to-Predictions(P2P) because we leverage the WiFi MAC layer traffic collected in the home and university environments to predict ""sleep"" and ""awake"" periods. We first manually established that extracting such patterns is feasible, and then, we trained various machine learning models to identify these patterns automatically.

The usage of real-time data analytics in health care has a great potential to improve and enhance the quality of health care services, including diagnosis and medical prescription. Stress is one of the major health issues these days, which leads to many acute and sometimes incurable diseases to the students of very young age. Stress affects physiological parameters of the human body; due to these, human emotions may also change. This research paper proposes a hybrid model for pervasive stress detection, which deals with imbalance class problems using real-time data analytics and Internet of Things and it also presents a new stress analysis system to detect stressful conditions of the student, and to diagnose whether they are stressed or relaxed by using a designed set of experimental tasks. Regular monitoring of students'/professionals' health, including measurement of Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, provides a good understanding of their stress level. Data are acquired by using GSR and ECG sensors for 34 participants while undertaking five different tasks discussed in the proposed experiment. The graphical relationship between heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance across various experimental activities highlights the fact as to how physiological parameters of the human body get affected along with the mental status of the students. This article performs accuracy computation by using different machine-learning models such as Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Bagging Classifiers (BAG), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) followed by tuning with the best set of hyper parameters for each model. The proposed hybrid classification model deals with the class imbalance problem by using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. The shrewd ANN-based hybrid model achieves 99.4% accuracy on the self-generated dataset for the mental state classification of the students, which is best among other classifiers such as LR, SVM, KNN, BAG, RF, GB, and ANN. The prediction result of all 34 participants of the experiment is also classified into four categories: relaxed, stressed, partially stressed, and happy.","The authors are thankful to AISTDF and the authorities of the “Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad at Prayagraj,” for providing the necessary infrastructure and support.","This research work is partially supported by “ASEAN-India Science & Technology Development Fund (AISTDF),” SERB, Sanction letter no.

Therefore, we propose a method for detecting student distraction during e-learning lectures using machine learning, based on human face and posture information that can be collected using only an ordinary web camera. In this study, we first collected video data of the faces of subjects taking e-learning lectures and used the OpenFace and GAST-Net libraries to obtain face and posture information.

There is a pressing need to develop clinically informed computerized tools to enable rapid, reliable assessment of the linguistic understandability of specialized health and medical education resources. This paper fills a critical gap in current patient-oriented health resource development, which requires reliable and accurate evaluation instruments to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of health education resource evaluation.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to translate internationally endorsed clinical guidelines to machine learning algorithms to facilitate the evaluation of the understandability of health resources for international students at Australian universities.
METHODS: Based on international patient health resource assessment guidelines, we developed machine learning algorithms to predict the linguistic understandability of health texts for Australian college students (aged 25-30 years) from non-English speaking backgrounds. We compared extreme gradient boosting, random forest, neural networks, and C5.0 decision tree for automated health information understandability evaluation. The 5 machine learning models achieved statistically better results compared to the baseline logistic regression model. We also evaluated the impact of each linguistic feature on the performance of each of the 5 models.
RESULTS: We found that information evidentness, relevance to educational purposes, and logical sequence were consistently more important than numeracy skills and medical knowledge when assessing the linguistic understandability of health education resources for international tertiary students with adequate English skills (International English Language Testing System mean score 6.5) and high health literacy (mean 16.5 in the Short Assessment of Health Literacy-English test). Our results challenge the traditional views that lack of medical knowledge and numerical skills constituted the barriers to the understanding of health educational materials.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning algorithms were developed to predict health information understandability for international college students aged 25-30 years. Thirteen natural language features and 5 evaluation dimensions were identified and compared in terms of their impact on the performance of the models. Health information understandability varies according to the demographic profiles of the target readers, and for international tertiary students, improving health information evidentness, relevance, and logic is critical.",,,JMIR Medical Informatics,,Tianyong Hao,,2021-05-06,2021,2021-05-06,,9,5,e28413,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ji, Meng; Liu, Yanmeng; Zhao, Mengdan; Lyu, Ziqing; Zhang, Boren; Luo, Xin; Li, Yanlin; Zhong, Yin","Ji, Meng (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia); Liu, Yanmeng (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia); Zhao, Mengdan (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia); Lyu, Ziqing (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia; School of Foreign Languages, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Zhenjiang, China); Zhang, Boren (School of Languages and Cultures, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia); Luo, Xin (Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; The HK PolyU-PKU Research Centre on Chinese Linguistics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Li, Yanlin (Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; The HK PolyU-PKU Research Centre on Chinese Linguistics, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Zhong, Yin (Department of English, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong; Research Centre for Professional Communication in English, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong)","Liu, Yanmeng (The University of Sydney)","Ji, Meng (The University of Sydney); Liu, Yanmeng (The University of Sydney); Zhao, Mengdan (The University of Sydney); Lyu, Ziqing (The University of Sydney; Jiangsu University of Science and Technology); Zhang, Boren (The University of Sydney); Luo, Xin (Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Li, Yanlin (Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University); Zhong, Yin (Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University)",7,3,1.69,4.62,https://medinform.jmir.org/2021/5/e28413/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136797449,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,4 Quality Education

As a result, educational institutions worldwide are currently using online learning platforms to maintain their education presence. This research paper introduces and examines a dataset, E-LearningDJUST, that represents a sample of the student’s study progress during the pandemic at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST). The dataset depicts a sample of the university’s students as it includes 9,246 students from 11 faculties taking four courses in spring 2020, summer 2020, and fall 2021 semesters. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first collected dataset that reflects the students’ study progress within a Jordanian institute using e-learning system records. One of this work’s key findings is observing a high correlation between e-learning events and the final grades out of 100. Thus, the E-LearningDJUST dataset has been experimented with two robust machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one simple deep learning model (Feed Forward Neural Network) to predict students’ performances. Using RMSE as the primary evaluation criteria, the RMSE values range between 7 and 17. Among the other main findings, the application of feature selection with the random forest leads to better prediction results for all courses as the RMSE difference ranges between (0–0.20). Finally, a comparison study examined students’ grades before and after the Coronavirus pandemic to understand how it impacted their grades. A high success rate has been observed during the pandemic compared to what it was before, and this is expected because the exams were online. However, the proportion of students with high marks remained similar to that of pre-pandemic courses.",We gratefully acknowledge the Deanship of Research at the Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) for supporting this work via Grants #20200064 and #20210039.

Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.
Participants: We collected visual acuity, behavioral, environmental, and genetic data from 7,472 students in 21 primary and secondary schools (grades 1-12) in Jiamusi, Heilongjiang Province, using visual acuity screening and questionnaires.
Methods: Machine learning algorithms were used to construct myopia classification models for students at the whole schooling period, primary school, junior high school, and senior high school period, and to rank the importance of features in each model.
Results: The main influencing factors for students differ by school section, The optimal machine learning model for the whole schooling period was Random Forest (AUC = 0.752), with the top three influencing factors being age, myopic grade of the mother, and Whether myopia requires glasses. The optimal model for the primary school period was a Random Forest (AUC = 0.710), with the top three influences being the myopic grade of the mother, age, and extracurricular tutorials weekly. The Junior high school period was an Support Vector Machine (SVM; AUC = 0.672), and the top three influencing factors were gender, extracurricular tutorial subjects weekly, and whether can you do the ""three ones"" when reading and writing. The senior high school period was an XGboost (AUC = 0.722), and the top three influencing factors were the need for spectacles for myopia, average daily time spent outdoors, and the myopic grade of the mother.
Conclusion: Factors such as genetics and eye use behavior all play an essential role in students' myopia, but there are differences between school periods, with those in the lower levels focusing on genetics and those in the higher levels focusing on behavior, but both play an essential role in myopia.","The authors thank the staff, teachers of each school, students and parents of students who participated in this survey.","This study was supported by Jiamusi University, special task project for prevention and control of myopia in children and adolescents (JMSUSKZX-ZD003).",Frontiers in Public Health,,,Female; Humans; Retrospective Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Myopia; Students; Schools; Machine Learning,2023-06-01,2023,2023-06-01,,11,,1169128,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tong, Hao-Jie; Huang, Ze-Min; Li, Yu-Lan; Chen, Yi-Ming; Tian, Ben; Ding, Ling-Ling; Zhu, Li-Ling","Tong, Hao-Jie (School of Public Health, Jiamusi University, Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, China); Huang, Ze-Min (School of Public Health, Jiamusi University, Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, China); Li, Yu-Lan (School of Public Health, Jiamusi University, Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, China); Chen, Yi-Ming (School of Public Health, Jiamusi University, Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, China); Tian, Ben (School of Public Health, Jiamusi University, Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, China); Ding, Ling-Ling (Clinical College of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China); Zhu, Li-Ling (School of Public Health, Jiamusi University, Jiamusi, Heilongjiang, China)","Zhu, Li-Ling (Jiamusi University)","Tong, Hao-Jie (Jiamusi University); Huang, Ze-Min (Jiamusi University); Li, Yu-Lan (Jiamusi University); Chen, Yi-Ming (Jiamusi University); Tian, Ben (Jiamusi University); Ding, Ling-Ling (Anhui Medical University); Zhu, Li-Ling (Jiamusi University)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1169128/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158539341,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,

When untreated, gender dysphoria is associated with depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance misuse. Technology-delivered interventions for transgender and nonbinary people can be used discretely, safely, and flexibly, thereby reducing treatment barriers and increasing access to psychological interventions to manage distress that accompanies gender dysphoria. Technology-delivered interventions are beginning to incorporate machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) to automate intervention components and tailor intervention content. A critical step in using ML and NLP in technology-delivered interventions is demonstrating how accurately these methods model clinical constructs.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the preliminary effectiveness of modeling gender dysphoria with ML and NLP, using transgender and nonbinary people's social media data.
METHODS: Overall, 6 ML models and 949 NLP-generated independent variables were used to model gender dysphoria from the text data of 1573 Reddit (Reddit Inc) posts created on transgender- and nonbinary-specific web-based forums. After developing a codebook grounded in clinical science, a research team of clinicians and students experienced in working with transgender and nonbinary clients used qualitative content analysis to determine whether gender dysphoria was present in each Reddit post (ie, the dependent variable). NLP (eg, n-grams, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, word embedding, sentiment, and transfer learning) was used to transform the linguistic content of each post into predictors for ML algorithms. A k-fold cross-validation was performed. Hyperparameters were tuned with random search. Feature selection was performed to demonstrate the relative importance of each NLP-generated independent variable in predicting gender dysphoria. Misclassified posts were analyzed to improve future modeling of gender dysphoria.
RESULTS: Results indicated that a supervised ML algorithm (ie, optimized extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost]) modeled gender dysphoria with a high degree of accuracy (0.84), precision (0.83), and speed (1.23 seconds). Of the NLP-generated independent variables, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) clinical keywords (eg, dysphoria and disorder) were most predictive of gender dysphoria. Misclassifications of gender dysphoria were common in posts that expressed uncertainty, featured a stressful experience unrelated to gender dysphoria, were incorrectly coded, expressed insufficient linguistic markers of gender dysphoria, described past experiences of gender dysphoria, showed evidence of identity exploration, expressed aspects of human sexuality unrelated to gender dysphoria, described socially based gender dysphoria, expressed strong affective or cognitive reactions unrelated to gender dysphoria, or discussed body image.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that ML- and NLP-based models of gender dysphoria have significant potential to be integrated into technology-delivered interventions. The results contribute to the growing evidence on the importance of incorporating ML and NLP designs in clinical science, especially when studying marginalized populations.","The authors would like to thank Jasmine Valdez and Andre Guaderrama for their assistance during the coding process.

2685,pub.1157552336,10.2196/28848,37561568,,A Fast and Minimal System to Identify Depression Using Smartphones: Explainable Machine Learning–Based Approach,"BACKGROUND: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial. Additionally, due to the requirement of running systems in the background for prolonged periods, existing systems can be resource inefficient. As a result, these systems can be infeasible in low-resource settings.
OBJECTIVE: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time. Another objective was to explain the machine learning (ML) models that were best for identifying depression.
METHODS: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage data and responses to the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse set of ML models: linear, tree-based, and neural network-based models. We selected important features using the stable approach, along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches: filter, wrapper, and embedded methods. We developed and validated the models using the nested cross-validation method. Additionally, we explained the best ML models through the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method.
RESULTS: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students (precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). Feature importance analysis suggested app usage behavioral markers containing diurnal usage patterns as being more important than aggregated data-based markers. In addition, a SHAP analysis of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to depression. For instance, students who were not depressed spent more time on education apps on weekdays, whereas those who were depressed used a higher number of photo and video apps and also had a higher deviation in using photo and video apps over the morning, afternoon, evening, and night time periods of the weekend.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive systems to better understand students who are depressed and take steps for intervention.","We thank all participants who voluntarily donated data.

We aimed to identify and optimize contributing factors responsible for onset of precocious puberty via machine learning/deep learning algorithms in girls.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed among girls aged 6-16 years from 26 schools in Beijing based on a cluster sampling method. Information was gleaned online via questionnaires. Machine/deep learning algorithms were performed using Python language (v3.7.6) on PyCharm platform.
Results: Of 11308 students enrolled, there are 5527 girls, and 408 of them had experienced precocious puberty. Training 13 machine learning algorithms revealed that gradient boosting machine (GBM) performed best in predicting precocious puberty. By comparison, six top factors including maternal age at menarche, paternal body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio, maternal BMI, screen time, and physical activity were sufficient in prediction performance, with accuracy of 0.9530, precision of 0.9818, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.7861. The performance of the top six factors was further validated by deep learning sequential model, with accuracy reaching 92.9%.
Conclusions: We identified six important factors from both parents and girls that can help predict the onset of precocious puberty among Chinese girls.","We are grateful to all participating students, and their parents or guardians for their kind cooperation and willingness, as well as school teachers in charge, and health physicians for their generous help.

Forty-seven healthy college students were recruited, and their exhaled breath samples (n = 235) were collected and analyzed for VOCs before, on, and after two separate haze pollution episodes using gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (GC-IMS). Using a paired t-test and machine learning model (Gradient Boosting Machine, GBM), six exhaled VOC species including propanol and isoprene were revealed to differ significantly among pre-, on-, and post-exposure in both haze episodes, while none was found between clean control days. The GBM model was shown capable of differentiating between pre- and on-exposure to haze pollution with a precision of 90-100% for both haze episodes. However, poor performance was detected for the same model between two different clean days. In addition to gender and particular haze occurrence influences, correlation analysis revealed that NH4+, NO3-, acetic acid, mesylate, CO, NO2, PM2.5, and O3 played important roles in the changes in breath-borne VOC fingerprints following haze air pollution exposure.

A novel approach, ML-based survival analysis, remains unstudied for predicting mortality after cardiac surgery. We aimed to benchmark performance, as measured by the concordance index (C-index), of tree-based survival models against Cox proportional hazards (CPH) modeling and explore risk factors using the best-performing model.
Methods: 144,536 patients with 147,301 surgery events from the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) national database were used to train and validate models. Univariate analysis was performed using Student's T-test for continuous variables, Chi-squared test for categorical variables, and stratified Kaplan-Meier estimation of the survival function. Three ML models were tested, a decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). Hyperparameter tuning was performed using a Bayesian search strategy. Performance was assessed using 2-fold cross-validation repeated 5 times.
Results: The highest performing model was the GBM with a C-index of 0.803 (0.002), followed by RF with 0.791 (0.003), DT with 0.729 (0.014), and finally CPH with 0.596 (0.042). The 5 most predictive features were age, type of procedure, length of hospital stay, drain output in the first 4 h (ml), and inotrope use greater than 4 h postoperatively.
Conclusion: Tree-based learning for survival analysis is a non-parametric and performant alternative to CPH modeling. GBMs offer interpretable modeling of non-linear relationships, promising to expose the most relevant risk factors and uncover new questions to guide future research.","The ANZSCTS National Cardiac Surgery Database Program is funded by the Department of Health (Victoria), the Clinical Excellence Commission (NSW), Queensland Health (QLD), and funding from individual cardiac surgical units participating in the registry.

The characteristics of high immersion and interactivity enhance virtual reality (VR) application in psychological therapy. Many studies have verified the effectiveness of VR relaxation therapy, although a few have performed a quantitative study on relaxation state (R-state). To confirm the effectiveness of VR relaxation and quantitatively assess relaxation, this study confirmed the effectiveness of the VR sightseeing relaxation scenes using subjective emotion scale and objective electroencephalogram (EEG) data from college students. Moreover, some EEG features with significant consistent differences after they watched the VR scenes were detected including the energy ratio of the alpha wave, gamma wave, and differential asymmetry. An R-state regression model was then built using the model stacking method for optimization, of which random forest regression, AdaBoost, gradient boosting (GB), and light GB were adopted as the first level, while linear regression and support vector machine were applied at the second level. The leave-one-subject-out method for cross-validation was used to evaluate the results, where the mean accuracy of the framework achieved 81.46%. The significantly changed features and the R-state model with over 80% accuracy have laid a foundation for further research on relaxation interaction systems. Moreover, the VR relaxation therapy was applied to the clinical treatment of patients with depression and achieved preliminary good results, which might provide a possible method for non-drug treatment of patients with depression.",We would also like to thank all participants and thank the Guangzhou First People’s Hospital for medical support.

However, most studies were limited to one data mining technique under one specific scenario. The current study demonstrates the usage of four frequently used supervised techniques, including Classification and Regression Trees (CART), gradient boosting, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and two unsupervised methods, Self-organizing Map (SOM) and k-means, fitted to one assessment data. The USA sample (N = 426) from the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) responding to problem-solving items is extracted to demonstrate the methods. After concrete feature generation and feature selection, classifier development procedures are implemented using the illustrated techniques. Results show satisfactory classification accuracy for all the techniques. Suggestions for the selection of classifiers are presented based on the research questions, the interpretability and the simplicity of the classifiers.

Social inequality, violence, and malnutrition have strong impact on youth health. To better understand these issues we propose to combine machine-learning methods and graph analysis to build predictive networks applied to the Brazilian National Student Health Survey (PenSE 2015) data, a large dataset that consists of questionnaires filled by the students. By using a combination of gradient boosting machines and centrality hub metric, it was possible to identify potential confounders to be considered when conducting association analyses among variables. The variables were ranked according to their hub centrality to predict the other variables from a directed weighted-graph perspective. The top five ranked confounder variables were ""gender"", ""oral health care"", ""intended education level"", and two variables associated with nutrition habits-""eat while watching TV"" and ""never eat fast-food"". In conclusion, although causal effects cannot be inferred from the data, we believe that the proposed approach might be a useful tool to obtain novel insights on the association between variables and to identify general factors related to health conditions.",,The authors are thankful to São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP grants number 2018/04654-9; 2018/21934-5; 2016/19376-9; 2019/17907-5).,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Brazil; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Nutrition Assessment; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors,2019-12-21,2019,2019-12-21,2020-01-01,17,1,90,All OA; Gold,Article,"Oku, Amanda Yumi Ambriola; Morais, Guilherme Augusto Zimeo; Bueno, Ana Paula Arantes; Fujita, André; Sato, João Ricardo","Oku, Amanda Yumi Ambriola (Center of Mathematics, Computing and Cognition—Universidade Federal do ABC, Santo André CEP 09210-580, Brazil); Morais, Guilherme Augusto Zimeo (Big Data—Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo CEP 05652-900, Brazil); Bueno, Ana Paula Arantes (Center of Mathematics, Computing and Cognition—Universidade Federal do ABC, Santo André CEP 09210-580, Brazil); Fujita, André (Institute of Mathematics and Statistics—University of São Paulo, São Paulo CEP 05508-090, Brazil); Sato, João Ricardo (Center of Mathematics, Computing and Cognition—Universidade Federal do ABC, Santo André CEP 09210-580, Brazil)","Sato, João Ricardo (Universidade Federal do ABC)","Oku, Amanda Yumi Ambriola (Universidade Federal do ABC); Morais, Guilherme Augusto Zimeo (Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein); Bueno, Ana Paula Arantes (Universidade Federal do ABC); Fujita, André (Universidade de São Paulo); Sato, João Ricardo (Universidade Federal do ABC)",2,1,0.1,0.47,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/1/90/pdf?version=1576914883,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123636042,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,2 Zero Hunger

The vast majority of the works found in literature are usually focusing on experimentation of techniques and methods over datasets restricted to a given discipline, course, or institution and are still few works manipulating region and countrywide datasets. This may be since the implementation of LA in national or regional scope and using data from governments and institutions poses many challenges that may threaten the success of such initiatives, including the same availability of data. The present article describes the experience of LA in Latin America using governmental data from Elementary and Middle Schools of the State of Norte de Santander - Colombia. This study is focusing on students' performance. Data from 2013 to 2018 was collected, containing information related to 1) students' enrollment in school disciplines provided by Regional Education Secretary, 2) students qualifications provided by educational institutions, and 3) students qualifications provided by the national agency for education evaluation. The methodology followed includes a process of cleaning and integration of the data, subsequently a descriptive and visualization analysis is made and some educational data mining techniques are used (decision trees and clustering) for the modeling and extraction of some educational patterns. A total of eight patterns of interest are extracted. In addition to the decision trees, a feature ranking analysis was performed using xgboost and to facilitate the visual representation of the clusters, t-SNE and self-organized maps (SOM) were applied as result projection techniques. Finally, this paper compares the main challenges mentioned by the literature according to the Colombian experience and proposes an up-to-date list of challenges and solutions that can be used as a baseline for future works in this area and aligned with the Latin American context and reality.","The development of this research was possible thanks to the funding received by: 1) The research program &quot;Reconstrucción del Tejido Social en Zonas de Posconflicto en Colombia&quot; SIGP Code: 57579 with the research project &quot;Fortalecimiento docente desde la Alfabetización Mediática Informacional y la CTel, como estrategia didáctico-pedagógica y soporte para la recuperación de la confianza del tejido social afectado por el conflicto&quot; SIGP code 58950 Funded with the Colombia Científica call, [Contract No FP44842-213-2018]. 2) The training program &quot;Capital Humano de Alto Nivel para el Departamento de Norte de Santander” - Call 753 of Colciencias, and partially supported by CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) [Edital Universal, proc.404369/2016-2] [DT-2 Productivity in Technological Development and Innovative Extension scholarship, proc.315445/2018-1].","This work was supported by Minisciences -The training program ""High Level Human Capital for the Department of Norte de Santander"" - Call 753 of Colciencias, and partially supported by CNPq (Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development) [Edital Universal, proc.404369/2016-2] [DT-2 Productivity in Technological Development and Innovative Extension scholarship, proc. 315445/2018-1 and Colciencias - The research program ""Reconstruction of the Social Fabric in Post-Conflict Zones in Colombia"" SIGP Code: 57579 with the research project ""Teaching strengthening from Informational Media Literacy and CTel, as a didactic-pedagogical strategy and support for the recovery of trust in the fabric social affected by the conflict ""SIGP code 58950 Funded with the Colombia Científica call, [Contract No FP44842-213-2018].",Heliyon,,,,2021-09-17,2021,2021-09-17,2021-09,7,9,e08017,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hernández-Leal, Emilcy; Duque-Méndez, Néstor Darío; Cechinel, Cristian","Hernández-Leal, Emilcy (Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Colombia; Universidad de Medellín, Colombia); Duque-Méndez, Néstor Darío (Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Colombia); Cechinel, Cristian (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil)","Duque-Méndez, Néstor Darío (National University of Colombia)","Hernández-Leal, Emilcy (National University of Colombia; Universidad de Medellín); Duque-Méndez, Néstor Darío (National University of Colombia); Cechinel, Cristian (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina)",3,3,,3.34,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844021021204/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141186631,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education",4 Quality Education

Machine learning can identify suicidal individuals based on their language samples. This feasibility pilot was conducted to explore this technology's use in adolescent therapy sessions and assess machine learning model performance.
METHOD: Natural language processing machine learning models to identify level of suicide risk using a smartphone app were tested in outpatient therapy sessions. Data collection included language samples, depression and suicidality standardized scale scores, and therapist impression of the client's mental state. Previously developed models were used to predict suicidal risk.
RESULTS: 267 interviews were collected from 60 students in eight schools by ten therapists, with 29 students indicating suicide or self-harm risk. During external validation, models were trained on suicidal speech samples collected from two separate studies. We found that support vector machines (AUC: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.69-0.81) and logistic regression (AUC: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70-0.82) lead to good discriminative ability, with an extreme gradient boosting model performing the best (AUC: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.72-0.84).
CONCLUSION: Voice collection technology and associated procedures can be integrated into mental health therapists' workflow.

Adolescents deserve specific attention because they are under a great variety of stresses and are at risk for mental disorders during adulthood.
AIM: The present paper aims to predict undergraduate students' SWB by machine learning method.
METHODS: Gradient Boosting Classifier which was an innovative yet validated machine learning approach was used to analyse data from 10 518 Chinese adolescents. The online survey included 298 factors such as depression and personality. Quality control procedure was used to minimise biases due to online survey reports. We applied feature selection to achieve the balance between optimal prediction and result interpretation.
RESULTS: The top 20 happiness risks and protective factors were finally brought into the predicting model. Approximately 90% individuals' SWB can be predicted correctly, and the sensitivity and specificity were about 92% and 90%, respectively.

Since there is no effective medical treatment, early diagnosis and surgical resection are the only way to cure ACC completely. However, early diagnosis of ACC is sometimes tricky because there are no useful diagnostic biomarkers to differentiate ACC from benign adrenal tumors. Therefore, we aimed to identify circulating protein biomarkers to distinguish malignant from benign adrenal tumors using mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.   Methods Plasma samples were obtained from 27 patients with ACC and 69 age- and sex-matched patients with adrenal adenoma. We performed the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a data-independent acquisition (DIA) method in plasma samples. Among the quantified 381 proteins, differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were selected using Student's t-tests for pairwise comparison with a false discovery rate < 0. 05 and |fold-change|> 1.5. In addition, we performed machine learning algorithms such as random forest and XGBoost to select featured DEPs to discriminate ACC.   Results The mean age of patients was 52 years, and 38 (39.6%) patients were male. Among 19 DEPs, 8 proteins were overexpressed and 11 were underexpressed in ACC patients. In a further analysis using machine learning algorithms, random forest identified 4 proteins as important features for establishing the classifier. The panels with these four proteins showed a good discrimination performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94 and an accuracy of 0.96. Eight proteins were identified in the XGBoost algorithm. Four proteins in plasma samples were common DEPs from the traditional methods and machine learning algorithms.   Conclusions High plasma levels of two proteins (One is involved in the migration, attachment and organization of cells into tissues. The other is V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin light chains), and low plasma levels of two proteins (One is involved in cell-cell adhesion and recognition. The other is V region of the variable domain of immunoglobulin heavy chain) might be circulating protein biomarkers of ACCs compared with benign adrenal adenomas.

Methods: This retrospective study included 105 patients with meningiomas, including 60 NF2-mutant samples and 45 wild-type samples. Radiomic features were extracted from magnetic resonance imaging scans, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and contrast T1-weighted images. Student's t-test and LASSO regression were performed to select the radiomic features. All patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. Five linear models (RF, SVM, LR, KNN, and xgboost) were trained to predict the NF2 mutational status. Receiver operating characteristic curve and precision-recall analyses were used to evaluate the model performance. Student's t-tests were then used to compare the posterior probabilities of NF2 mut/loss prediction for patients with different NF2 statuses.
Results: Nine features had nonzero coefficients in the LASSO regression model. No significant differences was observed in the clinical features. Nine features showed significant differences in patients with different NF2 statuses. Among all machine learning algorithms, SVM showed the best performance. The area under curve and accuracy of the predictive model were 0.85; the F1-score of the precision-recall curve was 0.80. The model risk was assessed by plotting calibration curves. The p-value for the H-L goodness of fit test was 0.411 (p> 0.05), which indicated that the difference between the obtained model and the perfect model was statistically insignificant. The AUC of our model in external validation was 0.83.
Conclusion: A combination of radiomic analysis and machine learning showed potential clinical utility in the prediction of preoperative NF2 status. These findings could aid in developing customized neurosurgery plans and meningioma management strategies before postoperative pathology.",,,Frontiers in Oncology,,,,2022-09-28,2022,2022-09-28,,12,,879528,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sun, Shuchen; Ren, Leihao; Miao, Zong; Hua, Lingyang; Wang, Daijun; Deng, Jiaojiao; Chen, Jiawei; Liu, Ning; Gong, Ye","Sun, Shuchen (Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurosurgery, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Function Restoration and Neural Regeneration, Shanghai, China); Ren, Leihao (Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurosurgery, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Function Restoration and Neural Regeneration, Shanghai, China); Miao, Zong (Department of Neurosurgery, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University (Second Military Medical University), Shanghai, China); Hua, Lingyang (Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurosurgery, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Function Restoration and Neural Regeneration, Shanghai, China); Wang, Daijun (Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurosurgery, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Function Restoration and Neural Regeneration, Shanghai, China); Deng, Jiaojiao (Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurosurgery, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Function Restoration and Neural Regeneration, Shanghai, China); Chen, Jiawei (Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurosurgery, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Function Restoration and Neural Regeneration, Shanghai, China); Liu, Ning (Department of Neurosurgery, Changhai Hospital, Naval Medical University (Second Military Medical University), Shanghai, China); Gong, Ye (Department of Neurosurgery, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Institute of Neurosurgery, Fudan University, Shanghai, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Brain Function Restoration and Neural Regeneration, Shanghai, China; Department of Critical Care Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China)","Gong, Ye (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University; Huashan Hospital; Fudan University)","Sun, Shuchen (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University); Ren, Leihao (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University); Miao, Zong (Changhai Hospital; Second Military Medical University); Hua, Lingyang (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University); Wang, Daijun (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University); Deng, Jiaojiao (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University); Chen, Jiawei (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University); Liu, Ning (Changhai Hospital; Second Military Medical University); Gong, Ye (Huashan Hospital; Fudan University; Fudan University; East China Normal University; Huashan Hospital; Fudan University)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.879528/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151407528,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being
2247,pub.1147402764,10.1109/access.2022.3170421,,,Predicting Student Employability Through the Internship Context Using Gradient Boosting Models,"Universities around the world are keen to develop study plans that will guide their graduates to success in the job market. The internship course is one of the most significant courses that provides an experiential opportunity for students to apply knowledge and to prepare to start a professional career. However, internships do not guarantee employability, especially when a graduate’s internship performance is not satisfactory and the internship requirements are not met. Many factors contribute to this issue making the prediction of employability an important challenge for researchers in the higher education field. In this paper, our aim is to introduce an effective method to predict student employability based on context and using Gradient Boosting classifiers. Our contributions consist of harnessing the power of gradient boosting algorithms to perform context-aware employability status prediction processes. Student employability prediction relies on identifying the most predictive features impacting the hiring opportunity of graduates. Hence, we define two context models, which are the student context based on the student features and the internship context based on internship features. Experiments are conducted using three gradient boosting classifiers: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Category Boosting (CatBoost) and Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM). The results obtained showed that applying LGBM classifiers over the internship context performs the best compared to student context. Therefore, this study provides strong evidence that the employability of graduates is predictable from the internship context.","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research &amp; Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this research work through the project number PNU-DRI-RI-20-003.",,IEEE Access,,,,2022-01-01,2022,2022-04-25,2022-01-01,10,,46472-46489,All OA; Gold,Article,"Saidani, Oumaima; Menzli, Leila Jamel; Ksibi, Amel; Alturki, Nazik; Alluhaidan, Ala Saleh","Saidani, Oumaima (Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, 11671, Saudi Arabia); Menzli, Leila Jamel (Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, 11671, Saudi Arabia); Ksibi, Amel (Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, 11671, Saudi Arabia); Alturki, Nazik (Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, 11671, Saudi Arabia); Alluhaidan, Ala Saleh (Department of Information Systems, College of Computer and Information Sciences, Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, 11671, Saudi Arabia)","Alturki, Nazik (Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University)","Saidani, Oumaima (Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University); Menzli, Leila Jamel (Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University); Ksibi, Amel (Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University); Alturki, Nazik (Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University); Alluhaidan, Ala Saleh (Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University)",7,7,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9668973/09762923.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147402764,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

It affects not only the individual who drops out but also the former school, family, and society in general. With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.","This work is supported in part by projects of the National Science Foundation of China (41971340, 41471333, 61304199), and projects of Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology (2018Y3001, 2018H0001, 2019I0019).",,Computers and Education Artificial Intelligence,,,,2022,2022,,2022,3,,100066,All OA; Gold,Article,"Niyogisubizo, Jovial; Liao, Lyuchao; Nziyumva, Eric; Murwanashyaka, Evariste; Nshimyumukiza, Pierre Claver","Niyogisubizo, Jovial (Fujian Key Lab for Automotive Electronics and Electric Drive, Fujian University of Technology, 350118, China); Liao, Lyuchao (Fujian Key Lab for Automotive Electronics and Electric Drive, Fujian University of Technology, 350118, China); Nziyumva, Eric (Fujian Key Lab for Automotive Electronics and Electric Drive, Fujian University of Technology, 350118, China); Murwanashyaka, Evariste (Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China); Nshimyumukiza, Pierre Claver (Integrated Polytechnic Regional College (IPRC), Karongi, Rwanda)","Niyogisubizo, Jovial (Fujian University of Technology)","Niyogisubizo, Jovial (Fujian University of Technology); Liao, Lyuchao (Fujian University of Technology); Nziyumva, Eric (Fujian University of Technology); Murwanashyaka, Evariste (Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics); Nshimyumukiza, Pierre Claver ()",20,20,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.caeai.2022.100066,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146625019,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,4 Quality Education

Various liver function tests, Child–Pugh score (CPS) and Model for End-stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD-Na) score were collected as candidate predictors for insufficient hepatic enhancement. Insufficient hepatic enhancement was assessed using liver-to-portal vein signal intensity ratio and 5-level visual grading. The clinico-laboratory findings were compared using Student’s t-test and Mann–Whitney U test. Relationships between the laboratory tests and insufficient hepatic enhancement were assessed using Pearson’s and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Feature importance was assessed by Random UnderSampling boosting algorithms. The predictive models were constructed using decision tree(DT), k-nearest neighbor(KNN), random forest(RF), and support-vector machine(SVM) classifier algorithms. The performances of the prediction models were analyzed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(AUC).ResultsAmong four machine learning classifier algorithms using various feature combinations, SVM using total bilirubin(TB) and albumin(Alb) showed excellent predictive ability for insufficient hepatic enhancement(AUC = 0.93, [95% CI: 0.93–0.94]) and higher AUC value than conventional logistic regression(LR) model (AUC = 0.92, [95% CI; 0.92–0.93], predictive models using the MELD-Na (AUC = 0.90 [95% CI: 0.89–0.91]) and CPS (AUC = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.88–0.90]).ConclusionMachine learning-based classifier (i.e. SVM) and feature selection algorithms can be used to predict insufficient hepatic enhancement in the HBP before performing MRI.Graphic abstract",This work was supported by Soonchunhyang university.,,Abdominal Radiology,,,Algorithms; Contrast Media; End Stage Liver Disease; Gadolinium DTPA; Humans; Liver; Machine Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index,2021-10-13,2021,2021-10-13,2022-01,47,1,161-173,Closed,Article,"Ko, Ji Su; Byun, Jieun; Park, Seongkeun; Woo, Ji Young","Ko, Ji Su (Department of Radiology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Byun, Jieun (Department of Radiology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Radiology, College of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Park, Seongkeun (Machine Intelligence Laboratory, Department of Smart Automobile, Soonchunhyang University, Asan, Chungcheongnamdo, Republic of Korea); Woo, Ji Young (Department of Radiology, Hallym University College of Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea)","Byun, Jieun (Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital; Ewha Womans University)","Ko, Ji Su (Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital); Byun, Jieun (Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital; Ewha Womans University); Park, Seongkeun (Soonchunhyang University); Woo, Ji Young (Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital)",6,6,,4.03,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141849704,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

OBJECTIVES: To develop machine learning (ML) models to predict recurrent lumbar disc herniation (rLDH) following percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1159 patients who had undergone single-level PELD for lumbar disc herniation (LDH) between July 2014 to December 2019 at our institution. Various preoperative imaging variables and demographic metrics were brought in analysis. Student's t test and Chi-squared test were applied for univariate analysis, which were feature selection for ML models. We established ML models to predict rLDH: Artificial neural networks (ANN), Extreme Gradient Boost classifier (XGBoost), KNeighborsClassifier (KNN), Decision tree classifier (Decision Tree), Random forest classifier (Random Forest), and support vector classifier (SVC).
RESULTS: A total 130 patients (11.22%) were diagnosed as rLDH in 1159 patients. Recurrence occurred within 10.25 ± 11.05 months. Body mass index (BMI) (P = .027), facet orientation (FO) (P < .001), herniation type (P = .012), Modic changes (P = .004), and disc calcification (P = .013) are significant factors in univariate analysis (P < .05). Extreme Gradient Boost classifier, Random Forest, ANN showed fine area under the curve, .9315, .9220, and .8814 respectively.
CONCLUSION: We developed a deep learning and 2 ensemble models with fine performance in prediction of rLDH following PELD. Predicting re-herniation before surgery has the potential to optimize decision-making and meaningfully decrease the rates of rLDH following PELD. Our ML model identified higher BMI, lower FO, Modic changes, disc calcification in a non-protrusive region, and herniation type (noncontained herniation) as significant features for predicting rLDH.",,,Global Spine Journal,,,,2022-05-02,2022,2022-05-02,2022-05-02,,,21925682221097650,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ren, GuanRui; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Po; Xie, ZhiYang; Wang, PeiYang; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Hui; Shen, MeiJi; Deng, LiTing; Tao, YuAo; Li, Xi; Wang, JiaoDong; Wang, YunTao; Wu, XiaoTao","Ren, GuanRui (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Liu, Lei (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Zhang, Po (Nanjing Integrated Traditional Chinese And Western Medicine Hospital, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.); Xie, ZhiYang (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Wang, PeiYang (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Zhang, Wei (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Wang, Hui (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Shen, MeiJi (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Deng, LiTing (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Tao, YuAo (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Li, Xi (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Wang, JiaoDong (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Wang, YunTao (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.); Wu, XiaoTao (Department of Spine Surgery, Zhongda Hospital, Medical College, 12579Southeast University, Nanjing, China.)",,"Ren, GuanRui (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Liu, Lei (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Zhang, Po (Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine); Xie, ZhiYang (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Wang, PeiYang (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Zhang, Wei (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Wang, Hui (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Shen, MeiJi (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Deng, LiTing (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Tao, YuAo (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Li, Xi (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Wang, JiaoDong (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Wang, YunTao (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University); Wu, XiaoTao (Zhongda Hospital Southeast University)",5,5,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/21925682221097650,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147577163,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The aim of this study was to develop prediction model to identify Korean adolescents of high risk suicide (= who have history of suicide ideation/attempt in previous year) using machine learning techniques.
METHODS: A nationally representative dataset of Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS) was used (n = 59,984 of middle and high school students in 2017). The classification process was performed using machine learning techniques such as logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB).
RESULTS: A total of 7,443 adolescents (12.4%) had a previous history of suicidal ideation/attempt. In the multivariable analysis, sadness (odds ratio [OR], 6.41; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 6.08-6.87), violence (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 2.01-2.67), substance use (OR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.52-2.45), and stress (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.40-1.86) were associated factors. Taking into account 26 variables as predictors, the accuracy of models of machine learning techniques to predict the high-risk suicidal was comparable with that of LR; the accuracy was best in XGB (79.0%), followed by SVM (78.7%), LR (77.9%), RF (77.8%), and ANN (77.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: The machine leaning techniques showed comparable performance with LR to classify adolescents who have previous history of suicidal ideation/attempt.

The participants completed the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) loneliness questionnaire at the beginning and end of the semester. For a classification purpose, the scores were categorized into high (questionnaire score>40) and low (≤40) levels of loneliness. Daily features were extracted from both devices to capture activity and mobility, communication and phone usage, and sleep behaviors. The features were then averaged to generate semester-level features. We used 3 analytic methods: (1) statistical analysis to provide an overview of loneliness in college students, (2) data mining using the Apriori algorithm to extract behavior patterns associated with loneliness, and (3) machine learning classification to infer the level of loneliness and the change in levels of loneliness using an ensemble of gradient boosting and logistic regression algorithms with feature selection in a leave-one-student-out cross-validation manner.
RESULTS: The average loneliness score from the presurveys and postsurveys was above 43 (presurvey SD 9.4 and postsurvey SD 10.4), and the majority of participants fell into the high loneliness category (scores above 40) with 63.8% (102/160) in the presurvey and 58.8% (94/160) in the postsurvey. Scores greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean were observed in 12.5% (20/160) of the participants in both pre- and postsurvey scores. The majority of scores, however, fell between 1 standard deviation below and above the mean (pre=66.9% [107/160] and post=73.1% [117/160]). Our machine learning pipeline achieved an accuracy of 80.2% in detecting the binary level of loneliness and an 88.4% accuracy in detecting change in the loneliness level. The mining of associations between classifier-selected behavioral features and loneliness indicated that compared with students with low loneliness, students with high levels of loneliness were spending less time outside of campus during evening hours on weekends and spending less time in places for social events in the evening on weekdays (support=17% and confidence=92%). The analysis also indicated that more activity and less sedentary behavior, especially in the evening, was associated with a decrease in levels of loneliness from the beginning of the semester to the end of it (support=31% and confidence=92%).
CONCLUSIONS: Passive sensing has the potential for detecting loneliness in college students and identifying the associated behavioral patterns. These findings highlight intervention opportunities through mobile technology to reduce the impact of loneliness on individuals' health and well-being.",This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Number IIS1816687 and Carnegie Mellon University.,,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,,Athanasios Tsanas,Adolescent; Behavior Observation Techniques; Data Analysis; Data Mining; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Los Angeles; Machine Learning; Male; Microwaves; Phenotype; Sedentary Behavior; Sleep; Smartphone; Social Isolation; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2019-07-24,2019,2019-07-24,,7,7,e13209,All OA; Gold,Article,"Doryab, Afsaneh; Villalba, Daniella K; Chikersal, Prerna; Dutcher, Janine M; Tumminia, Michael; Liu, Xinwen; Cohen, Sheldon; Creswell, Kasey; Mankoff, Jennifer; Creswell, John D; Dey, Anind K","Doryab, Afsaneh (School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States; School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, The University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States); Villalba, Daniella K (Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Chikersal, Prerna (School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Dutcher, Janine M (Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Tumminia, Michael (School of Education, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Liu, Xinwen (Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Cohen, Sheldon (Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Creswell, Kasey (Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Mankoff, Jennifer (Paul G Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States); Creswell, John D (Department of Psychology, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, United States); Dey, Anind K (Information School, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States)","Doryab, Afsaneh (Carnegie Mellon University; University of Virginia)","Doryab, Afsaneh (Carnegie Mellon University; University of Virginia); Villalba, Daniella K (Carnegie Mellon University); Chikersal, Prerna (Carnegie Mellon University); Dutcher, Janine M (Carnegie Mellon University); Tumminia, Michael (University of Pittsburgh); Liu, Xinwen (Carnegie Mellon University); Cohen, Sheldon (Carnegie Mellon University); Creswell, Kasey (Carnegie Mellon University); Mankoff, Jennifer (University of Washington); Creswell, John D (Carnegie Mellon University); Dey, Anind K (University of Washington)",86,44,4.3,30.92,https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/7/e13209/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1117147056,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,3 Good Health and Well Being

The aim of this study was to determine the ability of glioma radiomics features from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the co-occurrence of IDHmut and MGMTmet by applying the tree-based pipeline optimization tool (TPOT), an automated machine learning (autoML) approach. This was a retrospective study, in which 162 patients with gliomas were evaluated, including 58 patients with co-occurrence of IDHmut and MGMTmet and 104 patients with other status comprising: IDH wildtype and MGMT unmethylated (n = 67), IDH wildtype and MGMTmet (n = 36), and IDHmut and MGMT unmethylated (n = 1). Three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted images, gadolinium-enhanced 3D T1-weighted images (Gd-3DT1WI), T2-weighted images, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images acquired at 3.0 T were used. Radiomics features were extracted from FLAIR and Gd-3DT1WI images. The TPOT was employed to generate the best machine learning pipeline, which contains both feature selector and classifier, based on input feature sets. A 4-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of automatically generated models. For each iteration, the training set included 121 subjects, while the test set included 41 subjects. Student's t-test or a chi-square test was applied on different clinical characteristics between two groups. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, kappa score, and AUC were used to evaluate the performance of TPOT-generated models. Finally, we compared the above metrics of TPOT-generated models to identify the best-performing model. Patients' ages and grades between two groups were significantly different (p = 0.002 and p = 0.000, respectively). The 4-fold cross-validation showed that gradient boosting classifier trained on shape and textual features from the Laplacian-of-Gaussian-filtered Gd-3DT1 achieved the best performance (average sensitivity = 81.1%, average specificity = 94%, average accuracy = 89.4%, average kappa score = 0.76, average AUC = 0.951). Using autoML based on radiomics features from MRI, a high discriminatory accuracy was achieved for predicting co-occurrence of IDHmut and MGMTmet in gliomas.

This study analyzes the differences in handwriting kinematic characteristics between AD patients and normal elderly people to model handwriting characteristics. The aim is to investigate whether handwriting analysis has a promising future in AD auxiliary screening or even auxiliary diagnosis and to provide a basis for developing a handwriting-based diagnostic tool.
Materials and methods: Thirty-four AD patients (15 males, 77.15 ± 1.796 years) and 45 healthy controls (20 males, 74.78 ± 2.193 years) were recruited. Participants performed four writing tasks with digital dot-matrix pens which simultaneously captured their handwriting as they wrote. The writing tasks consisted of two graphics tasks and two textual tasks. The two graphics tasks are connecting fixed dots (task 1) and copying intersecting pentagons (task 2), and the two textual tasks are dictating three words (task 3) and copying a sentence (task 4). The data were analyzed by using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test to obtain statistically significant handwriting characteristics. Moreover, seven classification algorithms, such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used to build classification models. Finally, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Area Under Curve (AUC) were used to assess whether writing scores and kinematics parameters are diagnostic.
Results: Kinematic analysis showed statistically significant differences between the AD and controlled groups for most parameters (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). The results found that patients with AD showed slower writing speed, tremendous writing pressure, and poorer writing stability. We built statistically significant features into a classification model, among which the model built by XGB was the most effective with a maximum accuracy of 96.55%. The handwriting characteristics also achieved good diagnostic value in the ROC analysis. Task 2 had a better classification effect than task 1. ROC curve analysis showed that the best threshold value was 0.084, accuracy = 96.30%, sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 93.41%, PPV = 92.21%, NPV = 100%, and AUC = 0.991. Task 4 had a better classification effect than task 3. ROC curve analysis showed that the best threshold value was 0.597, accuracy = 96.55%, sensitivity = 94.20%, specificity = 98.37%, PPV = 97.81%, NPV = 95.63%, and AUC = 0.994.

Most of the research in the educational field centers on demonstrating the student’s potential rather than focusing on faculty quality. This paper proposed a model, which is the fusion of stacking and voting ensemble, to evaluate faculty performance. We have considered two datasets; one is taken from the UCI machine learning repository (Teaching Assistant Evaluation) and another is collected from the students of a university. We have applied fifteen classification algorithms- K Nearest neighbors, Extra Tree, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, CatBoost Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Ridge Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Logistic Regression, Ada Boost Classifier, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, SVM—Linear Kernel, Naive Bayes, and proposed model using the python programming language. It is observed that the proposed model is giving 2% higher accuracy than results present in the literature on the teaching assistant evaluation dataset. The variable importance is also computed on the collected feedback, which gives the factors playing important roles in faculty performance. The analysis shows that the ability of faculty to link contents with real-life examples, faculty encouraged student's participation in class discussion, and faculty ability to inspire students to learn the course plays important roles in the performance of faculty.",,,International Journal of Information Technology,,,,2021-07-19,2021,2021-07-19,2021-10,13,5,1721-1731,Closed,Article,"Ahuja, Ravinder; Sharma, S.

1705,pub.1155122083,10.3390/su15032714,,,Achieving Personalized Precision Education Using the Catboost Model during the COVID-19 Lockdown Period in Pakistan,"With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to physical education on campus became difficult for everyone. Therefore, students and universities have been compelled to transition from in-person to online education. During this pandemic, online education, the use of unfamiliar digital learning tools, the lack of internet access, and the communication barriers between teachers and students made precision education more difficult. Customizing models from previous studies that only consider a single course in order to make a prediction reduces the predictive power of the model because it only considers a small subset of the attributes of each possible course. Due to a lack of data for each course, overfitting often occurs. It is challenging to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the student’s participation during the semester system or in a broader context. In this paper, a model that is flexible and more generalizable is developed to address these issues. This model resolves the problem of generalized models and overfitting by using a large number of responses from college and university students as a dataset that considered a broader range of attributes, regardless of course differences. CatBoost, an advanced type of gradient boosting algorithm, was used to conduct this research, and enabled the developed model to perform effectively and produce accurate results. The model achieved a 96.8% degree of accuracy. Finally, a comparison was made with other related work to demonstrate the concept, and the experimental results proved that the Catboost model is a viable, accurate predictor of students’ performance.","The authors extend their appreciation to King Saud University for funding this work through Researchers Supporting Project number (RSP2023R387), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","This research has received funding from King Saud University through Researchers Supporting Project number RSP2023R387), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Sustainability,,,,2023-02-02,2023,2023-02-02,,15,3,2714,All OA; Gold,Article,"Asad, Rimsha; Altaf, Saud; Ahmad, Shafiq; Mohamed, Adamali Shah Noor; Huda, Shamsul; Iqbal, Sofia","Asad, Rimsha (University Institute of Information Technology, Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan); Altaf, Saud (University Institute of Information Technology, Pir Mehr Ali Shah Arid Agriculture University, Rawalpindi 46300, Pakistan); Ahmad, Shafiq (Industrial Engineering Department, College of Engineering, King Saud University, P.O.

Approximately 40 percent of students seeking a bachelor’s degree do not graduate within 6 years; among nontraditional students, who make up half of the undergraduate population, dropout rates are even higher. In this study, we developed a machine learning classifier using the XGBoost model and data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) Longitudinal Study: 2012/14 to predict nontraditional student dropout. In comparison with baseline models, the XGBoost model and logistic regression model with features identified by the XGBoost model displayed superior performance in predicting dropout. The predictive ability of the model and the features it identified as being most important in predicting nontraditional student dropout can inform discussion among educators seeking ways to identify and support at-risk students early in their postsecondary careers.","We would like to thank Ryan Baker, Markus Broer, Enis Dogan, and Xiaying Zheng for valuable analytical advice.

First, the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) is used to predict the performance in online learning tasks. Then The Channel Attention Network (CAN) model further improves the function of LightGBM by focusing on better results in the K-fold CrossEntropy of LightGBM. The results are converted into predicted classes through post-processing methods named approximation of label distribution to complete the classification task.

This study uses machine learning models over two Chilean universities to predict first-year engineering student dropout over enrolled students, and to analyze the variables that affect the probability of dropout. The results show that instead of combining the datasets into a single dataset, it is better to apply a model per university. Moreover, among the eight machine learning models tested over the datasets, gradient-boosting decision trees reports the best model. Further analyses of the interpretative models show that a higher score in almost any entrance university test decreases the probability of dropout, the most important variable being the mathematical test.

          Depression is a psychiatric disorder characterized by low mood and anhedonia. The diagnosis of depression and the initiation of treatment is important for improving quality of life and avoiding disability. Machine learning (ML), can be used for solving classification and regression problems.In this study, scores of multiple psychiatric scales were used to detect depression and different ML algorithms were used to study if they can help for diagnosing depression accurately.


          Objectives
          The purpose of the study is to detect with high accuracy whether people are depressed or not by using widely used ML algorithms. It is also aimed to compare the algorithms used to predict depression with each other.


          Methods
          Data were collected from 96 university students. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory, Neo Personality Inventory, Chronic Stress Scale (CSS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PTSD), SHAPS, Relationship Scales Questionnaire and Dissociative Events Scale were applied. 14 points from the BDI was accepted as the cut-off value as depressed. Total scores of each scale was used as the dependent variable in the Xgboost (XGB) to classify the depression. By XGB, the most important 4 of these surveys and scales were selected to use in the Non-Linear (NL) models such as XGB, Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). Lastly, a linear model as a Logistic Regression (LR) model was also used to compare with the NL algorithms. The success of the models was measured with the Cross Validation method, which is the gold standard in ML.


          Results
          In the model in which all measurements are used as Independent Variables (IV), the XGB highlighted 4 scale scores: these are CSS, PSS, SHAPS and PTSD. All scale scores were used as IV, both XGB and DT classified depression with a success of 87.5%, while this score increased to 89.6% in both models when 4 prominent scales’ scores were used as IV. In the KNN, the classification made with prominent scales increased the success from 83% to 86%. The variance explanation rate of the LR model using 4 prominent scales remained at 58%.


          Conclusions
          With ML’s ability to solve NL relationships and dimensional reduction ability, models in which a large number of variables are input and there is no high correlation between dependent variables and IV can be classified with high success. Also, the success of the models was increased by choosing the most importants of the many IV and the variables that contributed negatively to the model could be excluded. The use of ML can yield promising results in fields such as psychiatry where linear relationships cannot be observed much.

Globally student dropout is a serious issue. Risk of dropouts can be identified at an earlier stage using machine learning classifiers, as they have gained more popularity in both academia and industry. The research team suggests that early prediction facilitates educators and higher education administrators to take necessary measures to prevent dropouts. Data for the research were collected from 530 Indian students when they were engaged in online learning during pandemic crisis. This research work involves two phases. In first phase, hybrid ensemble strategy is focused that integrates two powerful machine learning algorithms namely Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for early at-risk prediction. The result is a fast procedure for classification of at-risk students which is competitive in accuracy and highly robust. Prediction models are developed using ensemble learning, furthermore ensemble models are combined into a single meta-model, which provides best outcomes to enable higher education institutions for predictive analysis. Moreover, it correctly classified students’ at-risk regarding accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score with values of 93%, 91.52%, 96.42% and 93.91% respectively.

1388,pub.1154342161,10.1016/j.patcog.2023.109309,,,ProbSAP: A comprehensive and high-performance system for student academic performance prediction,"The student academic performance prediction is becoming an indispensable service in the computer supported intelligent education system. But conventional machine learning-based methods can only exploit the sparse discriminative features of student behaviors in imbalanced academic datasets to predict student academic performance (SAP). Furthermore, there is a lack of imbalanced data processing mechanisms that can efficiently capture student characteristics and achievement. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive and high-performance prediction framework to probe SAP characteristics (ProbSAP) on massive educational data, which can resolve imbalanced data issue and improve academic prediction performance for making course final mark prediction. It consists of three main components: collaborative data processing module for enhancing the data quality, scalable metadata clustering module for alleviating the imbalance of academic features, and XGBoost-enhanced SAP prediction module for academic performance forecasting. The collaborative data processing module integrates multi-dimensional academic data, which sustains a good supply for clustering and modeling in the ProbSAP framework. The comparative evaluation results demonstrate that ProbSAP delivers superior accuracy and efficiency improvement for the course final mark prediction of college students over other state-of-the-art methods such as CNN, SVR, RFR, XGBoost, Catboost-SHAP, and AS-SAN. On average, ProbSAP reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) by 84.76%, 72.11%, and 66.49% compared with XGBoost, Catboost-SHAP, and AS-SAN, respectively. It also leads to a better out-sample fit that minimizes prediction errors between 1% and 9% with over 98% of actual samples.",This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant 202213016.,,Pattern Recognition,,,,2023-05,2023,,2023-05,137,,109309,Closed,Article,"Wang, Xinning; Zhao, Yuben; Li, Chong; Ren, Peng","Wang, Xinning (Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266000, China); Zhao, Yuben (Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266000, China); Li, Chong (Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266000, China); Ren, Peng (China University Of Petroleum, Qingdao, 257099, China)","Li, Chong (Ocean University of China)","Wang, Xinning (Ocean University of China); Zhao, Yuben (Ocean University of China); Li, Chong (Ocean University of China); Ren, Peng (China University of Petroleum, East China)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154342161,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

It plays a key role in predicting students’ course performance based on their online learning behavior. It can optimize the effects of teaching and improve teaching strategies. Student performance prediction models that are built with a single algorithm currently have limited prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, model fusion improvement technology can combine many algorithms into a single model, thereby enhancing the overall effect of the model and providing better performance. In this paper, a stacking fusion model based on RF-CART–XGBoost–LightGBM is proposed. The first layer of the model uses a decision tree (CART), random forest, XGBoost and LightGBM as the base models. The second layer uses the LightGBM model. We used the Kalboard360 student achievement dataset, and features related to online learning behavior were selected as the model’s input for model training. Finally, we employed five-fold cross-validation to assess the model’s performance. In comparison with the four single models, the two fusion models based on the four single models both show significantly better performance. The prediction accuracies of the bagging fusion model and stacking fusion model are 83% and 84%, respectively. This proves that the proposed stacking fusion model has better performance, which helps to improve the accuracy of the performance prediction model further.

1334,pub.1154587851,10.3390/app13021143,,,All-Year Dropout Prediction Modeling and Analysis for University Students,"The core of dropout prediction lies in the selection of predictive models and feature tables. Machine learning models have been shown to predict student dropouts accurately. Because students may drop out of school in any semester, the student history data recorded in the academic management system would have a different length. The different length of student history data poses a challenge for generating feature tables. Most current studies predict student dropouts in the first academic year and therefore avoid discussing this issue. The central assumption of these studies is that more than 50% of dropouts will leave school in the first academic year. However, in our study, we found the distribution of dropouts is evenly distributed in all academic years based on the dataset from a Korean university. This result suggests that Korean students’ data characteristics included in our dataset may differ from those of other developed countries. More specifically, the result that dropouts are evenly distributed throughout the academic years indicates the importance of a dropout prediction for the students in any academic year. Based on this, we explore the universal feature tables applicable to dropout prediction for university students in any academic year. We design several feature tables and compare the performance of six machine learning models on these feature tables. We find that the mean value-based feature table exhibits better generalization, and the model based on the gradient boosting technique performs better than other models. This result reveals the importance of students’ historical information in predicting dropout.",,This work was supported by the Dong-A University research fund.,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-01-14,2023,2023-01-14,,13,2,1143,All OA; Gold,Article,"Song, Zihan; Sung, Sang-Ha; Park, Do-Myung; Park, Byung-Kwon","Song, Zihan (Department of Management Information Systems, Graduate School, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea); Sung, Sang-Ha (Department of Management Information Systems, Graduate School, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea); Park, Do-Myung (Smart Logistics R&D Center, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea); Park, Byung-Kwon (Department of Management Information Systems, Graduate School, Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Republic of Korea)","Park, Byung-Kwon (Dong-A University)","Song, Zihan (Dong-A University); Sung, Sang-Ha (Dong-A University); Park, Do-Myung (Dong-A University); Park, Byung-Kwon (Dong-A University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/2/1143/pdf?version=1673945121,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154587851,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,

However, many undergraduate students have reached the maximum length of study, but their completion status is unknown. This condition becomes a problem in calculating the actual number of graduates as it is used as an indicator of higher education evaluation and other policy references. Therefore, the unknown completion status of the students who have reached the maximum length of study must be predicted. The research compared the performance of Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classification models in predicting the unknown completion status. The research used a dataset containing 13.377 undergraduate students’ profiles from the Higher Education Database (PDDikti), Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. The dataset was incomplete, and the proportion of missing data was 20,9% of the total data. Because missing data might lead to prediction bias, the research also used MissForest imputation to overcome the missing data in the classification modelling and compared it to Mean/Mode and Median/Mode imputation. The results show that MissForest outperforms the other two imputations in both classifiers but requires the longest computation time. Furthermore, the XGBoost model with MissForest is significantly superior to the Random Forest model with MissForest. Hence, the best model chosen to predict the completion status is XGBoost with MissForest imputation.",,,ComTech Computer Mathematics and Engineering Applications,,,,2022-02-03,2022,2022-02-03,,13,1,53-62,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nirmala, Intan; Wijayanto, Hari; Notodiputro, Khairil Anwar","Nirmala, Intan (Institut Pertanian Bogor); Wijayanto, Hari (Institut Pertanian Bogor); Notodiputro, Khairil Anwar (Institut Pertanian Bogor)",,"Nirmala, Intan (IPB University); Wijayanto, Hari (IPB University); Notodiputro, Khairil Anwar (IPB University)",2,2,,,https://journal.binus.ac.id/index.php/comtech/article/download/7388/4478,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150213116,39 Education; 3903 Education Systems,4 Quality Education

However, it is challenging to fulfill the needs of consulting institutes and the office of academic affairs. To the consulting institute, the accuracy in the prediction is of the utmost importance; to the offices of academic affairs and other offices, the reason for dropping out is essential. This paper proposes a Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) system, a hybrid model to predict the students who are about to drop out of the university. The model tries to increase the dropout precision and the dropout recall rate in predicting the dropouts. We then analyzed the reason for dropping out by compressing the feature set with PCA and applying K-means clustering to the compressed feature set. The SDP system showed a precision value of 0.963, which is 0.093 higher than the highest-precision model of the existing works. The dropout recall and F1 scores, 0.766 and 0.808, respectively, were also better than those of gradient boosting by 0.117 and 0.011, making them the highest among the existing works; Then, we classified the reasons for dropping out into four categories: “Employed”, “Did Not Register”, “Personal Issue”, and “Admitted to Other University.” The dropout precision of “Admitted to Other University” was the highest, at 0.672. In post-verification, the SDP system increased counseling efficiency by accurately predicting dropouts with high dropout precision in the “High-Risk” group while including more dropouts in total dropouts. In addition, by predicting the reasons for dropouts and presenting guidelines to each department, the students could receive personalized counseling.",,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. NRF2021R1A2C1014163).,Applied Sciences,,,,2023-05-20,2023,2023-05-20,,13,10,6275,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kim, Sangyun; Choi, Euteum; Jun, Yong-Kee; Lee, Seongjin","Kim, Sangyun (Department of Informatics, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju-daero 501, Jinjusi 52828, Republic of Korea;, summer@gnu.ac.kr); Choi, Euteum (Research Center for Aircraft Parts Technology, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju-daero 501, Jinjusi 52828, Republic of Korea;, etchoi@gnu.ac.kr); Jun, Yong-Kee (Division of Aerospace and Software Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju-daero 501, Jinjusi 52828, Republic of Korea; Department of Bio & Medical Bigdata (BK4+ Program), Gyeongsang National University, Jinju-daero 501, Jinjusi 52828, Republic of Korea); Lee, Seongjin (Department of AI Convergence Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju-daero 501, Jinjusi 52828, Republic of Korea)","Jun, Yong-Kee (Gyeongsang National University; Gyeongsang National University); Lee, Seongjin (Gyeongsang National University)","Kim, Sangyun (Gyeongsang National University); Choi, Euteum (Gyeongsang National University); Jun, Yong-Kee (Gyeongsang National University; Gyeongsang National University); Lee, Seongjin (Gyeongsang National University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/10/6275/pdf?version=1684831955,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158266395,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,3 Good Health and Well Being

The main purpose of this research is to develop machine learning algorithms for predicting the percentage of student placement based on the data related to the university’s academic reputation, opportunities of the city where the university is located, facilities and cultural opportunities of the university. When the model accuracy was evaluated on the basis of performance metrics, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm showed greater predictive accuracy than other machine learning approaches. A sensitivity analysis was performed using the extreme gradient boosting machines algorithm to identify the degree to which the input variables contribute to the determination of the output variable. Five input variables, namely the percentage of student placement at year t-1, the university scientific document score, university Phd programme score, university faculty member/student score, and the percentage of student placement at year t-2 were found to be the most effective parameters.

However, students’ behavioral data have not been thoroughly studied for understanding their career choice. In this study, we used eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), a machine learning (ML) technique, to predict the career choice of college students using a real-world dataset collected in a specific college. Specifically, the data include information on the education and career choice of 18,000 graduates during their college years. In addition, SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanation) was employed to interpret the results and analyze the importance of individual features. The results show that XGBoost can predict students’ career choice robustly with a precision, recall rate, and an F1 value of 89.1%, 85.4%, and 0.872, respectively. Furthermore, the interaction of features among four different choices of students (i.e., choose to study in China, choose to work, difficulty in finding a job, and choose to study aboard) were also explored. Several educational features, especially differences in grade point average (GPA) during their college studying, are found to have relatively larger impact on the final choice of career.

Accordingly, many universities, including Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), changed the teaching method from face-to-face education to electronic learning from a distance. This research paper investigated the impact of the e-learning experience on the students during the spring semester of 2020 at JUST. It also explored how to predict students’ academic performances using e-learning data. Consequently, we collected students’ datasets from two resources: the center for e-learning and open educational resources and the admission and registration unit at the university. Five courses in the spring semester of 2020 were targeted. In addition, four regression machine learning algorithms had been used in this study to generate the predictions: random forest (RF), Bayesian ridge (BR), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The results showed that the ensemble model for RF and XGBoost yielded the best performance. Finally, it is worth mentioning that among all the e-learning components and events, quiz events had a significant impact on predicting the student’s academic performance.

However, high dropout rate has become a prominent problem that hinders the further development of MOOCs. Therefore, the prediction of student dropouts is the key to further enhance the MOOCs platform. The traditional dropout prediction models based on machine learning are difficult to guarantee the prediction effect due to the shortcomings such as insufficient mining of feature information and not considering the influence of time series. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose the learning behavior feature fused deep learning network model (LBDL) for MOOC dropout prediction. The core of the model lies in modeling different types of information separately and incorporating them into an overall framework. In the data processing stage, the LBDL model divides the data features into video learning behavior features containing time series information and general information features. For video learning behavior features, the model uses Bi-LSTM and attention mechanisms to mine time series information, and for general information features, it uses embedding layer and fully connected layer for processing. A hidden vector containing both types of feature information can be obtained by two different modeling approaches. Then the original feature information is combined to train the gradient boosting framework LightGBM. Experiments on the MOOCCube video dataset show that the AUC and F1-Score of our model can reach 82.39% and 74.89%, respectively, which are higher than other baseline models. It indicates that the proposed LBDL model has better performance in the dropout rate prediction problem.",All authors would like to thank all the participants who devoted their time and energy in taking part in the experiments.

This study hence proposes a novel machine learning (ML) method where the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm is coupled with the state-of-the-art Student Psychology-Based Optimization method (SPBO) to predict base resistance of piles. A dataset (796 datapoints) from well-instrumented static load tests among various projects in the soft soil region of Ho Chi Minh City is used to develop the model. Five input parameters including the applied load, loading point displacement, axial stiffness, SPT value of the soil beneath the pile toe, and the distance from the loading point to the pile toe are considered. Performance of the coupled SPBO-XGBoost model is comprehensively assessed by comparing it with other optimized XGBoost models including the Teaching-Learning Based Optimization, Bayesian Optimization, and other well-known ML techniques. The established model is used to predict data obtained from independent studies and compared with practice design codes of pile foundation. The results show that the proposed SPBO-XGBoost model outperforms all other models considering the prediction accuracy and reliability. Sensitivity analysis and Partial Dependence Plots are conducted to gain insights into the base resistance mechanism, giving considerable implications to design practice of pile foundation.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

It has become a paramount importance for any institute to identify the student at risk of underperforming or failing or even drop out from the course. Machine Learning techniques may be used to develop a model for predicting student’s performance as early as at the time of admission. The task however is challenging as the educational data required to explore for modelling are usually imbalanced. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques namely bagging algorithm like random forest (rf) and boosting algorithms like adaptive boosting (adaboost), stochastic gradient boosting (gbm), extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) in an attempt to develop a model for predicting the student’s performance of a private university at Meghalaya using three categories of data namely demographic, prior academic record, personality. The collected data are found to be highly imbalanced and also consists of missing values. We employ k-nearest neighbor (knn) data imputation technique to tackle the missing values. The models are developed on the imputed data with 10 fold cross validation technique and are evaluated using precision, specificity, recall, kappa metrics. As the data are imbalanced, we avoid using accuracy as the metrics of evaluating the model and instead use balanced accuracy and F-score. We compare the ensemble technique with single classifier C4.5. The best result is provided by random forest and adaboost with F-score of 66.67%, balanced accuracy of 75%, and accuracy of 96.94%.",,,Webology,,,,2021-04-29,2021,,2021-04-29,18,Special Issue 01,183-195,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lenin, Thingbaijam; Chandrasekaran, N.","Lenin, Thingbaijam (); Chandrasekaran, N.

We evaluate these ML models against classification performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and predicted run time. The empirical analysis includes two contributions: 1. It examines the performance of various ML models on a survey-based educational dataset, inferring a significant classification performance by a tree-based XGBoost algorithm; 2.

The research sample consists of a total of 67,329 students who took the PISA 2015 exam from 13 randomly selected countries (Brazil, Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Peru, Singapore, Türkiye). In this study, multiple linear regression, support vector regression, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithms were used. For the machine learning process, a randomly determined part from the PISA-2015 data of each country researched was divided as training data and the remaining part as testing data to evaluate model performance. As a result of the research, it was determined that the XGBoost algorithm showed the best performance in estimating both PISA-2015 test data and PISA-2018 science academic achievement scores in all researched countries. Furthermore, it was determined that the highest PISA-2018 science achievement scores of the students who participated in the exam, estimated by this algorithm, were in Luxembourg (r = 0.600, RMSE = 75.06, MAE = 59.97), while the lowest were in Finland (r = 0.467, RMSE = 79.38, MAE = 63.24).

An increasing attention has been recently given to machine learning (ML) methods for SM retrieval that provide promising performance. Nevertheless, most of them are based on a supervised learning strategies that depend on the used labeled training samples. In fact, they are unaffordable or costly. In this letter, new teacher–student for SM estimation, called (TS-SME), relying on teacher–student (TS) framework using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data, was proposed to estimate SM. The main advantage of this framework is to enroll a large amount of unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data. Experiments were carried out on two arid areas in southern Tunisia. The input data include the backscatter coefficient in two-mode polarization ($\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VV}}$ and $\sigma ^{\circ }_{\textrm {VH}}$ ) for Sentinel-1A, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) for Sentinel-2A and in situ measurements.

As a consequence, this paper proposed a new intelligent, fair assessment of online examinations for virtual and remotely controlled laboratory experiments running through Laboratory Learning Systems. The main idea is to provide students with an environment similar to being physically present in a Laboratory while conducting practical experiments and exams and detecting cheating with high accuracy at a minimal cost. Therefore, an intelligent assessment module is designed to detect cheating students by analyzing their mouse dynamics using Artificial Intelligence. The mouse interaction behavior method was chosen because it does not require any additional resources, such as a camera and eye tribe tracker, to detect cheating. Various AI algorithms, such as KNN, SVC, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM have been used to classify student mouse behavior to detect cheating, and many metrics are used to evaluate their performance.

We estimated the level of attention while students watched a video lecture by measuring reaction time (RT) to detect a target sound that was irrelevant to the lecture. We assumed that RT to such a stimulus would be longer when participants were focusing on the lecture compared with when they were not. We sought to estimate how much learners focus on a lecture using RT measurement. In the experiment, the learner’s face was recorded by a video camera while watching a video lecture. Facial features were analyzed to predict RT to a task-irrelevant stimulus, which was assumed to be an index of the level of attention. We applied a machine learning method, light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to estimate RTs from facial features extracted as action units (AUs) corresponding to facial muscle movements by an open-source software (OpenFace). The model obtained using LightGBM indicated that RTs to the irrelevant stimuli can be estimated from AUs, suggesting that facial expressions are useful for predicting attentional states while watching lectures. We re-analyzed the data while excluding RT data with sleepy faces of the students to test whether decreased general arousal caused by sleepiness was a significant factor in the RT lengthening observed in the experiment. The results were similar regardless of the inclusion of RTs with sleepy faces, indicating that facial expression can be used to predict learners’ level of attention to video lectures.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2023-07-21,2023,2023-07-21,,11,,76551-76562,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miao, Renjun; Kato, Haruka; Hatori, Yasuhiro; Sato, Yoshiyuki; Shioiri, Satoshi","Miao, Renjun (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Sendai, Japan); Kato, Haruka (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Sendai, Japan); Hatori, Yasuhiro (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Sendai, Japan); Sato, Yoshiyuki (Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Sendai, Japan); Shioiri, Satoshi (Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University, Miyagi, Sendai, Japan)",,"Miao, Renjun (Tohoku University); Kato, Haruka (Tohoku University); Hatori, Yasuhiro (Tohoku University); Sato, Yoshiyuki (Tohoku University); Shioiri, Satoshi (Tohoku University)",0,0,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/10190072.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1162634110,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,

In order for the instructor to understand how the student interacts with the various activities in the classroom, it is essential to predict their participation. The current work aims to identify the best algorithm for predicting student engagement in the classroom. In this paper, we gathered data from VLE and prepared them using a variety of data preprocessing techniques, including the elimination of missing values, normalization, encoding, and identification of outliers. On our data, we ran a number of machine learning (ML) classification algorithms, and we assessed each one using cross-validation methods and many helpful indicators. The performance of the model is evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores. The results show that the CATBoost model is having higher accuracy than the rest. This proposed model outperformed in all the aspects compared to previous research. The results part of this paper indicates that the CATBoost model had an accuracy of approximately 92.23%, a precision of 94.40%, a recall of 100%, and an AUC score of 0.9624. The XGBoost predictive model, the random forest model, and the multilayer perceptron model all demonstrated approximately the same performance overall. We compared the AISAR model with Our model achieved an accuracy of 94.64% compared with AISAR 91% model and it concludes that our results are better. The AISAR model had only around 50% recall compared to our models, which had around 92%.

However, a student could still get distracted and disengaged due to a variety of factors including stress, mind-wandering, unwanted noise, and external alerts. Student eye gaze data could be useful for detecting these distracted students. Gaze data-based visualizations have been proposed in the past to help a teacher monitor distracted students. However, it is not practical for a teacher to monitor a large number of student indicators while teaching. To help filter students based on distraction level, we propose an automated system based on machine learning to classify students based on their distraction level. The key aspects are: (1) we created a labeled eye gaze dataset from an educational VR environment, (2) we propose an automatic system to gauge a student’s distraction level from gaze data, and (3) we apply and compare several classifiers for this purpose. Each classifier classifies distraction, per educational activity section, into one of three levels (low, mid or high). Our results show that Random Forest (RF) classifier had the best accuracy (98.88%) compared to the other models we tested. Additionally, a personalized machine learning model using either RF, kNN, or Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was found to improve the classification accuracy significantly.","This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation, USA under Grant No. 1815976 and by the Louisiana Board of Regents, USA under contract No. LEQSF(2022–25)-RD-A-24.

Predicting students’ performance in advance could help assist the learning process; if “at-risk” students can be identified early on, educators can provide them with the necessary educational support. Despite this potential advantage, the technology for predicting students’ performance has not been widely used in education due to practical limitations. We propose a practical method to predict students’ performance in the educational environment using machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques. We conducted qualitative research to ascertain the perspectives of educational stakeholders. Twelve people, including educators, parents of K-12 students, and policymakers, participated in a focus group interview. The initial practical features were chosen based on the participants’ responses. Then, a final version of the practical features was selected through correlation analysis.

In order to advance the accuracy of school students’ entrepreneurial risk assessment within entrepreneurial practice background and reduce risk management factors, a model of school students’ entrepreneurial risk assessment grounded on the LightGBM algorithm is proposed. We construct the statistical probability density distribution and constraint parameter model of college students’ entrepreneurial risk distribution in an entrepreneurial practice environment. Moreover, we adopt the factor hierarchical classification technology of the evaluation index system to realize the framework model construction and big data fusion processing of college students’ entrepreneurial risk indicators in the entrepreneurial practice environment. Then, we extract the joint similarity feature set of college students’ entrepreneurial risk factors in the entrepreneurial practice environment and adopt the LightGBM feature detection and fuzzy matching technology. The self-adaptive optimization and fuzzy clustering analysis are realized in the procedure of school students’ entrepreneurial risk assessment under the entrepreneurial practice environment, and a fuzzy Bayesian network assessment model for school students’ entrepreneurial risk assessment under the entrepreneurial practice environment is constructed. The Delphi method is used to determine the pairwise influence relationship between factors, and the LightGBM algorithm is used to optimize the evaluation of college students’ entrepreneurial risk factors under the entrepreneurial practice environment and match rough set features. According to the comprehensive evaluation of entrepreneurial risk factors, the intelligent entrepreneurial risk assessment under the entrepreneurial practice environment is comprehended. The simulation outcomes confirm that the intelligence of college students’ entrepreneurial risk assessment in the entrepreneurial practice environment is improved, and the precision of risk assessment is greater than other approaches.",The great antiepidemic spirit promotes the discourse power of ideological work in colleges and universities (2021CIR30).

Some factors are considered, what kind of instructions, the readiness of the instructor and students in teaching and learning, evaluation and monitoring systems, and student expectations. Many factors are involved, and educators should know this. It is better if they can discern which are the prime factors and which the secondary factors. The purpose of the study is to find out the determinant factors in establishing the difficulty level of the subject from the students’, teachers’ and infrastructure point of view using three machine learning techniques. The MSE and the variable importance measurement were used to predict between some factors such as Attendance, Instructors, and other factors as independent variables and the difficulty level of the subject as a dependent variable. The study result showed that Gradient Boosting Machine obtained the MSE value result 1.14 and 1.30 for training and validation dataset. The model generated five variable importance as an independent factor, i.e. Attendance, Instructor, The course can give a new perspective to students, The quizzes, assignments, projects and exams contributed to helping the learning, and The Instructor was committed to the course and was understandable. The Gradient Boosting Machine is superior to other methods with the lowest MSE and MAE values results.

However, traditional research methods often struggle to capture the dynamic nature of media consumption and the intricate interactions between individuals and media content. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on leveraging social media data fusion and machine learning techniques to enhance the comprehension of student evolution. By integrating data from diverse social media sources and employing the CATBoost algorithm with the Greedy Target-based Statistics (Greedy TBS) technique, we aim to predict student outcomes based on a comprehensive set of attributes. The results showcase the superior performance of CATBoost in accurately capturing the complexities of student evolution, surpassing other machine learning algorithms.

Developing a smart solution to evaluate and track the efficiency of RACs is essentially useful for residents to make necessary maintenance or replacement decisions. While smart meters are increasingly installed to monitor electricity use, the application of smart meter data to evaluate the RAC efficiency remains inadequate. In this paper, we present a data-driven framework to identify non-inverter window RACs with low energy efficiency by analyzing smart meter data from the university student hall rooms. In this framework, we first applied the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) method to predict a RAC's hourly electricity consumption. Then we measured the effect of outdoor temperature on the XGBoost prediction of hourly RAC electricity consumption using the Shapley Additive Explanation method to interpret the RAC's efficiency. We conjectured that the RAC efficiency is normal if the predicted hourly electricity consumption is significantly correlated with the outdoor temperature. In contrast, the RAC efficiency is low if the outdoor temperature changes have little impact on the predicted electricity consumption. Finally, we applied the K-Means clustering algorithm to separate the RACs into the “low efficiency” and “normal efficiency” categories based on each's pattern of outdoor temperature's impact on electricity consumption. Our cross-validation result showed that the XGBoost model can achieve an average R2 score of 0.50 and an average root mean squared error of 0.20 kWh. We used RAC replacement records to validate our framework of interpreting the RAC's efficiency. On average, RACs having low efficiency consumed 25.69% more electricity per hour. Overall, our data-driven framework can contribute to extending the value of smart meters for RAC efficiency evaluation. Meanwhile, the smart meter data-driven framework can be improved, and more validation is needed in the future.",This project was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and the Sustainable Smart Campus project of HKUST.

In the new period of social development, the outstanding problems in teacher-student relationship have attracted wide attention of public opinion. This paper takes a full-time comprehensive higher vocational college formed by the merger of several specialized colleges as the target of the study, from which a valid target sample is selected. Based on the idea of SHIFU algorithm and greedy algorithm to construct the teacher-student relationship recognition model, we use XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) for optimization. Based on the four types of teacher-student relationships identified, a systematic strategy for building modern teacher-student relationships is structured from three aspects: society, school, and teachers and students. The following data were obtained by applying the proposed strategy to the target institutions: the values of the number of students answering questions and solving problems in the experimental class were 46.88% and 40.99% of the total number of students, respectively, which were 4.87% and 5.56% higher than those in the control class. The value of the number and frequency of cooperative exchanges between teachers and students in the experimental class is 52.76% of the total number and frequency, and the satisfaction rate between teachers and students is 49.57%. And the control class is only 44.16% vs. 39.77%. The number of students completing their homework in the experimental class was 95.82%, and the average assessment score was 64.16, which was higher than that of the control class.

The Grade Point Average (GPA), which is a reflection of academic performance, is considered to be the model output. Five different MLAs are considered to identify and rank the parameters affecting academic performance: multinomial logistic regression, artificial neural network, random forest, gradient boosting and stacking methods. To evaluate the performance of the MLAs, three metrics are utilized: precision, recall, and F1-score. It is observed that the gradient boosting method outperformed the other techniques by generating superior results, followed by random forest.

Design/methodology/approach This study used a conceptual framework of individual-level determinants of entrepreneurship and ML. The Google Survey instrument was prepared on a 5-point scale and administered to 656 students in different sections of the same class during regular virtual classrooms in 2021. The datasets were analyzed and compared using ML.   Findings Entrepreneurial traits existed among students before attending undergraduate entrepreneurship courses. Establishing strong partnerships (0.359), learning (0.347) and people-organizing ability (0.341) were promising correlated entrepreneurial traits. Female students exhibited fewer entrepreneurial traits than male students. The random forest model exhibited 60% accuracy in trait prediction against gradient boosting (58.4%), linear regression (56.8%), ridge (56.7%) and lasso regression (56.0%). Thus, the ML model appeared to be unsuitable to predict entrepreneurial traits. Quality data are important for accurate trait predictions.   Research limitations/implications Further studies can validate K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machine (SVM) models against random forest to support the statement that the ML model cannot be used for entrepreneurial trait prediction.   Originality/value This research is unique because ML models, such as random forest, gradient boosting and lasso regression, are used for entrepreneurial trait prediction by agricultural domain students.",The authors extend gratitude to the individuals who participated in the study.

These attacks exhibit physical symptoms that may easily lead to misdiagnosis. Deep-learning (DL)-based classification approaches for emotion detection based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals are computationally costly. Nowadays, limiting memory potency, considerable training, and hyperparameter optimization are always needed for DL models. As a result, they are inappropriate for real-time applications, which require large computational resources to detect anxiety and stress through EEG signals. However, a two-dimensional residual separable convolution network (RCN) architecture can considerably enhance the efficiency of parameter use and calculation time. The primary aim of this study was to detect emotions in undergraduate students who had recently experienced COVID-19 by analyzing EEG signals. A novel separable convolution model that combines residual connection (RCN-L) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) techniques was developed. To evaluate the performance, this paper used different statistical metrics. The RCN-L achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 0.9263, a sensitivity (SE) of 0.9246, a specificity (SP) of 0.9282, an F1-score of 0.9264, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9263 when compared to other approaches. In the proposed RCN-L system, the network avoids the tedious detection and classification process for post-COVID-19 emotions while still achieving impressive network training performance and a significant reduction in learnable parameters.

In the process of processing a large amount of data, there will be too little data. Therefore, this paper applies the improved SMOTE method to the data preprocessing, which can reduce the difficulty of collecting psychological stress test data while ensuring the amount of data. Firstly, we extracted features from cell phone data to generate samples, processed the samples by SMOTE, and then filtered features by XGBoost algorithm to filter features; meanwhile, we trained RF, SVM, BP, and KNN with the data before and after sampling and before and after feature screening, and the results showed that Improved SMOTE + XGBoost outperformed other methods.",This work was supported by the Psychological Health Education and Counseling Center.,,Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering,,Wei Liu,,2022-05-19,2022,,2022-05-19,2022,,1-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Du, Wei","Du, Wei (Psychological Health Education and Counseling Center, Jiaozuo Normal College, 454000 Henan, China)","Du, Wei ","Du, Wei ()",1,1,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jece/2022/2760986.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148040527,"40 Engineering; 4009 Electronics, Sensors and Digital Hardware",3 Good Health and Well Being

It has shown a high prediction accuracy against many other KT approaches. While, the desire to estimate more accurately the student level leads researchers to enhance PFA by inventing several advanced extensions. However, most of the proposed extensions have exclusively been improved in a pedagogical sense, as the improvements have mostly been limited to the analysis of students’ behaviour during their learning process. In contrast, Machine Learning provides many powerful methods that could be efficient to enhance, in the technical sense, the prediction of student performance. Our goal is to focus on the exploitation of Ensemble Learning methods as an extremely effective Machine Learning paradigm used to create many advanced solutions in several fields. In this sense, we propose a new PFA approach based on different models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost) in order to increase the predictive accuracy of student performance.

A possible solution is the formation of a collection of meta-subject materials stored in the library of learning scenarios of the Moscow Electronic School — now there are over 40,000 learning scenarios that have undergone moderation. This article presents the results of research that identified a cluster of teachers most inclined to create meta-subject scenarios and suggested recommendations for motivating teachers to create such scenarios. To achieve this purpose, a sample of authors of such scenarios published by the Moscow Electronic School were analyzed and clustered with the help of machine learning methods. As a result of this work, a gradient boosting algorithm was developed, which produced the best results. The clusters of users described as a result of the application of the algorithm followed five main behavior strategies in terms of the activity related to the creation of new scenarios. Teachers that are most likely to create meta-subject scenarios show interest in their colleagues’ scenarios not only in their subject but also in other academic disciplines taught at school, willingness to copy and customize them. To develop teachers’ readiness for the creation of meta-subject scenarios, it is recommended to conduct teacher training including their introduction to the best practices of developing such scenarios presented by the Moscow Electronic School.

This paper proposes a Stacked Generalization for Failure Prediction (SGFP) model to improve students’ results. The SGFP model mixes three ensemble learning classifiers, namely, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine (XGB), and Random Forest (RF), using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). In fact, the model relies on high-quality training and testing datasets that are collected automatically from the analytic reports of the Blackboard Learning Management System (i.e., analytic for learn (A4L) and full grade center (FGC) modules. The SGFP algorithm was validated using heterogeneous data reflecting students’ interactivity degrees, educational performance, and skills. The main output of SGFP is a classification of students into three performance-based classes (class A: above average, class B: average, class C: below average). To avoid failures, the SGFP model uses the Blackboard Adaptive Release tool to design three learning paths where students have to follow automatically according to the class they belong to. The SGFP model was compared to base classifiers (LGBM, XGB, and RF). The results show that the mean and median accuracies of SGFP are higher. Moreover, it correctly identified students’ classifications with a sensitivity average of 97.3% and a precision average of 97.2%. Furthermore, SGFP had the highest F1-score of 97.1%. In addition, the used meta-classifier MLP has more accuracy than other Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms, with an average of 97.3%. Once learned, tested, and validated, SGFP was applied to students before the end of the first semester of the 2020-2021 academic year at the College of Computer Sciences at Umm al-Qura University. The findings showed a significant increase in student success rates (98.86%). The drop rate declines from 12% to 1.14% for students in class C, for whom more customized assessment steps and materials are provided. SGFP outcomes may be beneficial for higher educational institutions within fully online or blended learning schemas to reduce the failure rate and improve the performance of program curriculum outcomes, especially in pandemic situations.",The authors would like to thank the Deanship of Scientific Research at Umm al-Qura University for supporting this work by grant code 18-EDU-1-01–0004.,,Scientific Programming,,Chenxi Huang,,2022-04-14,2022,,2022-04-14,2022,,1-15,All OA; Gold,Article,"Smirani, Lassaad K.; Yamani, Hanaa A.; Menzli, Leila Jamel; Boulahia, Jihane A.","Smirani, Lassaad K.

Since the programs are delivered online, a spike in social media use during lockdown resulted in many pupils becoming victims of cyberbullying, which includes criticizing one another, posting sexual comments on images of young ladies, and using fake accounts to bully others. Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are being used in a growing body of work on automated cyberbullying detection. Different machine learning methods, however, are unable to converge to the requisite accuracy. Thus, numerous classifier systems known as “ensemble learning” are proposed in order to improve predictive performance by aggregating the predictions from various models. In our proposed system, we use a novel method of detecting online harassment (cyberbullying) on the Instagram dataset. The attributes of abusive words are initially analyzed from feature selection and pre-trained word embedding language models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Embeddings from Language Models (ELMO). A knowledge-based frequent pattern method is used to find the intention of the harasser and is created by the Knowledge-BERT (K-BERT). The unsupervised approaches such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Frequent pattern growth (FP-Growth), and a clustering technique K-Means. The results from the detection models are ensembled using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying the categories of online harassment.

In this paper, an English score prediction method based on the XGBoost algorithm is proposed. In order to verify the effectiveness of the model in English score prediction, the principle of the XGBoost algorithm is firstly analyzed as a basis. The English test scores of a university for 2019–2021 were used as the basic data source, and the output probabilities of the proposed model were used to compare the results under different conditions. The experimental results show that the predicted scores are basically consistent with the actual scores. From a scientific point of view, the ability to predict unknown data with low error suggests that it enables students and teachers to identify the underlying factors that make it difficult for students to answer questions. Understanding these causes is useful for designing high-quality courses and lesson plans.",The work was supported by the 2021 Education and Teaching Reform project of Zhanjiang University of Science and Technology “A Research on Stratified College English Teaching Model for Application-oriented College” Project number: JG202155.,,Mobile Information Systems,,Mian Ahmad Jan,,2022-09-10,2022,,2022-09-10,2022,,1-11,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chen, Xiaohua","Chen, Xiaohua (Zhanjiang University of Science and Technology, Zhanjiang 524000, Guangdong, China)","Chen, Xiaohua ","Chen, Xiaohua ()",0,0,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2022/9263736.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150912481,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

Selama ini, sekolah menggunakan proses konvensional dalam menentukan jurusan, yaitu menggunakan Microsoft Excel, yang cenderung lama serta rawan akan kekeliruan dalam melakukan penghitungan. Penentuan jurusan ini dilakukan setiap awal ajaran baru pada siswa baru kelas X. Rata-rata setiap tahun, sekolah mengelola siswa sejumlah 290 dengan waktu dan sumber daya manusia yang terbatas. Pada penelitian ini, penggunaan algoritma ID3 tidak cocok karena data bertipe numerik, sedangkan ID3 hanya mampu menggunakan data bertipe nomial maupun polinomial, sehingga diganti algoritma C4.5. Namun, beberapa penelitian mengatakan algoritma C4.5 memiliki kinerja kurang bagus dibandingkan algoritma Gradient Boosting Trees , Random Forests , dan Deep Learning . Untuk itu, dilakukan perbandingan antara keempat metode tersebut untuk melihat keefektifannya dalam menentukan jurusan di SMA. Data yang digunakan pada penelitian ini adalah data penerimaan siswa baru tahun ajaran 2018/2019. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukkan jika atribut yang digunakan bertipe polinomial dengan Deep Learning memiliki kinerja paling unggul untuk semua algoritma jika menggunakan fungsi activation ExpRectifier. Sedangkan jika atributnya bertipe numerik, Deep Learning memiliki kinerja paling unggul untuk semua algoritma jika menggunakan fungsi Tanh untuk semua random sampling . Namun, Deep Learning memiliki kinerja paling buruk untuk semua algoritma jika menggunakan loss Function berupa absolut.     Abstract   In SMAN 1 Jombang, East Java, the process of determining the students’ majors referred to the 2013 curriculum in which not only the students’ own choices and specialization tests conducted in their first week of SMA were considered but also the student’s SMP grades (a report card, UN scores, and counseling teacher’s recommendation) and parents' recommendation. So far, the school had used Microsoft Excel which required a long time to do and was prone to calculation errors in the process of determination. The process was carried out, with limited time and human resources, at the beginning of a new academic year for grade X students, consisting of 290 students on average. In this present research, the use of ID3 algorithm was not suitable because of its numeric data type instead of nominal or polynomial data. Thus, the C4.5 algorithm was applied, instead. However, the performance of C4.5 algorithm was proved lower than the algorithms of Gradient Boosting Trees, Random Forests, and Deep Learning. Hence, a comparison of performance between them was done to see their effectiveness in the process. The data was the list of new students of the academic year 2018/2019. The results showed that if the attributes are polynomial, the Deep Learning algorithm had the best performance when using the ExpRectifier activation function. When they were numeric, Deep Learning has the most superior performance when using the Tanh function.

Due to this, a variety of data mining techniques, such as clustering, classification, and regression, are applied to anticipate the learner’s study behavior. By Machine Learning’s arrival, it has become vital to forecast students’ academic achievement, and this study attracts significant attention within the scientific community. In addition, the findings from this work have tremendous socio-economic consequences. One area of major research in the world of education today is educational data mining, which is the study of techniques to reveal hidden patterns in educational data. Data mining strategies succeed or fail to depend on the type and quality of the data that is being mined. Here, we provide a novel method that enhances the accuracy of prior student performance prediction by identifying and providing an explanation as to why it is rising. Using our robust machine learning ensemble models, we propose and evaluate a prediction model. The findings demonstrate that our CatBoost — an ensemble machine learning model — is superior to standard machine learning models with an accuracy of 92.27%. This new model was able to show itself to be dependable by the use of smote and hyperparameter optimization, which proved to be valuable methods and approaches. Additional features are significant as well. More critically, a unique method is utilized to increase model transparency. The SHAP values are a valuable part of the student performance prediction system, which we think should be integrated. For those educators tasked with using prediction models in education, we have found that there is a preference for models that offer both insightful insights and easy to understand predictions, as by utilizing our experiment the educator will be able to identify those students who are at early risk and inspire and encourage these students in a positive way.",,,Advances in Data Science and Adaptive Analysis,,,,2021-07,2021,2021-12-17,2021-07,13,03n04,2141002,Closed,Article,"Joshi, Abhisht; Saggar, Pranay; Jain, Rajat; Sharma, Moolchand; Gupta, Deepak; Khanna, Ashish","Joshi, Abhisht (Information Technology, Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology, GGSIPU, Delhi); Saggar, Pranay (Guru Teg Bahadur Institute of Technology, GGSIPU, Delhi); Jain, Rajat (Department of Computer Science & Engineering, MAIT, GGSIPU, Delhi); Sharma, Moolchand (Department of Computer Science & Engineering, MAIT, GGSIPU, Delhi); Gupta, Deepak (Department of Computer Science & Engineering, MAIT, GGSIPU, Delhi); Khanna, Ashish (Department of Computer Science & Engineering, MAIT, GGSIPU, Delhi)",,"Joshi, Abhisht (Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University); Saggar, Pranay (Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University); Jain, Rajat (Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University); Sharma, Moolchand (Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University); Gupta, Deepak (Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University); Khanna, Ashish (Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142933505,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,4 Quality Education

They frequently merely choose any sickness based on assumption, while those that determined the prevalence of the condition before developing their framework utilized survey data or data from web repositories, which removes idiosyncrasies from those data. In order to increase performance, this research suggests an enhanced data analytics framework for the predictive diagnosis of common illnesses affecting university students. In order to do this, exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a multivariate analytic technique was conducted using a high-level model methodology using CRISP-DM stages. When the suggested strategy was evaluated on support vector machines, ensemble gradient boosting, random forest, decision tree, K-neighbors, and linear regression machine learning models, experimental findings revealed that it outperformed current methods. In comparison to other reviewed frameworks that used survey datasets, standardized or online repositories' dataset, the framework with emphasis on the ensemble Gradient Boosting classifier and regression had accuracy of 100% and mean absolute error of 0.18, respectively.

Having more satisfied MOOC students can extend the reach of an institution to more people, build the brand name of the institution, and even help the institution use MOOCs as a source of revenue. Traditionally, student completion rate is frequently used to define MOOC success, which however, is often inaccurate because many students have no intention of finishing a MOOC. Informed by Moore's theory of transactional distance, this study adopted supervised machine learning algorithm, sentiment analysis and hierarchical linear modelling to analyze the course features of 249 randomly sampled MOOCs and 6393 students' perceptions of these MOOCs. The results showed that course instructor, content, assessment, and schedule play significant roles in explaining student satisfaction, while course structure, major, duration, video, interaction, perceived course workload and perceived difficulty play no significant roles. This study adds to the extant literature by examining specific learner-level and course-level factors that can predict MOOC learner satisfaction and estimating their relative effects.

The Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms were employed, and data from the Korean Council for University Education and the University Information Disclosure System were utilized for model development. The collected data spanned from 2011 to 2021 and included a total of 17 independent variables related to educational finance, educational conditions, and educational and research performance. The dropout rate was analyzed as the dependent variable. The final Random Forest and XGBoost models demonstrated the ability to explain 65% and 66% of the variability in the dropout rate, respectively. Using the two machine learning models, the top 10 explanatory variables were identified based on their importance, excluding the student enrollment rate. The models identified the following variables as important predictors of the dropout rate: expenditure per student for academic materials, research budget per full-time faculty member within the university, research budget per full-time faculty member outside the university, freshman enrollment rate, employee-to-student ratio, and employment rate. By examining the partial dependence plots of the five common important explanatory variables, it was analyzed how the predicted dropout rate changes in response to variations in these variables. Although there were differences in the curves between Random Forest and XGBoost, the overall direction and trends of the curves for the important explanatory variables were found to be similar. The improvement of these five important variables was found to have a negative correlation with the dropout rate, indicating a decrease in the predicted dropout rate. Based on these research findings, key implications and suggestions for further studies were provided.",,,The Korean Society for the Economics and Finance of Education,,,,2023-06-30,2023,2023-06-30,2023-06-30,32,2,57-77,Closed,Article,"Moon, Myung-Hyun; Kim, Gil-Jae","Moon, Myung-Hyun (); Kim, Gil-Jae ()",,"Moon, Myung-Hyun (); Kim, Gil-Jae ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160473486,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy",4 Quality Education
754,pub.1150949346,10.3390/electronics11182855,,,Electroencephalogram Signals for Detecting Confused Students in Online Education Platforms with Probability-Based Features,"Online education has emerged as an important educational medium during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the advantages of online education, it lacks face-to-face settings, which makes it very difficult to analyze the students’ level of interaction, understanding, and confusion. This study makes use of electroencephalogram (EEG) data for student confusion detection for the massive open online course (MOOC) platform. Existing approaches for confusion detection predominantly focus on model optimization and feature engineering is not very well studied. This study proposes a novel engineering approach that uses probability-based features (PBF) for increasing the efficacy of machine learning models. The PBF approach utilizes the probabilistic output from the random forest (RF) and gradient-boosting machine (GBM) as a feature vector to train machine learning models. Extensive experiments are performed by using the original features and PBF approach through several machine learning models with EEG data. Experimental results suggest that by using the PBF approach on EEG data, a 100% accuracy can be obtained for detecting confused students. K-fold cross-validation and performance comparison with existing approaches further corroborates the results.",,This research received no external funding.,Electronics,,,,2022-09-09,2022,2022-09-09,,11,18,2855,All OA; Gold,Article,"Daghriri, Talal; Rustam, Furqan; Aljedaani, Wajdi; Bashiri, Abdullateef H.; Ashraf, Imran","Daghriri, Talal (Department of Industrial Engineering, Jazan University, Jazan 82822, Saudi Arabia); Rustam, Furqan (School of Computer Science, University College Dublin, D04 V1W8 Dublin, Ireland); Aljedaani, Wajdi (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, TX 76203, USA); Bashiri, Abdullateef H.

Data were based on 9748 students from 4 English-speaking and 3 Chinese-speaking education systems participating in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 2016. A mixed theory-based and data-driven approach was adopted. Four machine learning algorithms, specifically logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, and extreme gradient boosting, were simultaneously used to classify and predict high- and low-proficiency readers and to identify the most important factors for the ability separation. The findings showed that for both system groups, those factors together were sufficiently powerful to discriminate the readers and that the affective constructs, particularly students’ self-concepts, played a predominant role. The Chinese-speaking systems, compared with their English counterparts, applied more effective pedagogies to nurture sophisticated readers.","This research was supported by the Philosophical and Social Sciences Planning Project of Zhejiang Province in 2020 [Grant Number 20NDJC01Z], the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Teaching Reform Research Projects in the 13th Five Year Plan of Higher Education of Zhejiang University.",,Reading and Writing,,,,2020-07-13,2020,2020-07-13,2021-01,34,1,199-230,Closed,Article,"Chen, Jiangping; Zhang, Yang; Hu, Jie","Chen, Jiangping (Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, 999077, Hong Kong SAR, China); Zhang, Yang (Beijing Institute of Big Data Research, Peking University, 100085, Beijing, China); Hu, Jie (Department of Linguistics, School of International Studies, Zhejiang University, 310058, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China)","Hu, Jie (Zhejiang University)","Chen, Jiangping (University of Hong Kong); Zhang, Yang (Beijing Institute of Big Data Research); Hu, Jie (Zhejiang University)",24,16,,22.51,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129323889,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

Several researchers are using real-time web applications to collect the responses of respondents. Demographic and geographic features are the most important in the researcher’s study. Identifying students’ demographics (gender, age-group, course, institution, or university) and geographic features (locality and country) is a challenging problem in machine learning. We proposed a novel predictive algorithm, Student Demographic Identification (SDI), to identify a student’s demographic features (age-group, course) with the highest accuracy. SDI has been tested on primary reliable samples. SDI has also been compared with the traditional machine algorithms Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR), and Radial Support Vector Machine (R–SVM). The proposed algorithm significantly improved the performance metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of these classifiers. We also proposed significant features to identify students’ age-group, course, and gender. SDI has identified the student’s age group with an accuracy of 96% and the course with an accuracy of 97%. Gradient Boosting (GB) has improved the accuracy of LR, R-SVM, and RF to predict the student’s gender. Also, the RF algorithm with the support of GB attained the highest accuracy of 98% to identify the gender of the students. All three classifiers have also identified the student’s locality and institution with an identical accuracy of 99%. Our proposed SDI algorithm may be useful for real-time survey applications to predict students’ demographic features.","The work of Chaman Verma supported under ÚNKP, MIT (Ministry of Innovation and Technology) and the National Research, Development and Innovation (NRDI) Fund, Hungarian Government.","The work of Chaman Verma, and Zoltán Illés was financially supported by Faculty of Informatics, Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE), Budapest, Hungary.",Mathematics,,,,2022-08-28,2022,2022-08-28,,10,17,3093,All OA; Gold,Article,"Verma, Chaman; Illés, Zoltán; Kumar, Deepak","Verma, Chaman (Department of Media and Educational Informatics, Faculty of Informatics, Eötvös Loránd University, 1053 Budapest, Hungary); Illés, Zoltán (Department of Media and Educational Informatics, Faculty of Informatics, Eötvös Loránd University, 1053 Budapest, Hungary); Kumar, Deepak (Apex Institute of Technology, Chandigarh University, Mohali 140413, Punjab, India)","Verma, Chaman (Eötvös Loránd University)","Verma, Chaman (Eötvös Loránd University); Illés, Zoltán (Eötvös Loránd University); Kumar, Deepak (Chandigarh University)",2,2,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/17/3093/pdf?version=1662439131,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150588023,49 Mathematical Sciences,

However, there is no suitable method for predicting academic performance for students participating in online class. Five machine learning models are employed to predict academic performance of an engineering mechanics course, taking online learning behaviors, comprehensive performance as input and final exam scores (FESs) as output. The analysis shows the gradient boosting regression model achieves the best performance with the highest correlation coefficient (0.7558), and the lowest RMSE (9.3595). Intellectual education score (IES) is the most important factor of comprehensive performance while the number of completed assignment (NOCA), the live viewing rate (LVR) and the replay viewing rate (RVR) of online learning behaviors are the most important factors influencing FESs. Students with higher IES are more likely to achieve better academic performance, and students with lower IES but higher NOCA tend to perform better. Our study can provide effective evidences for teachers to adjust teaching strategies and provide precise assistance for students at risk of academic failure in advance.",The authors would like to thank the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region for founding support and Alibaba Group for providing technical support of DingTalk platform.,This work was supported by the Middle-aged and Young Teachers' Basic Ability Promotion Project of Guangxi [grant number 2018KY0241].,Interactive Learning Environments,,,,2023-01-30,2023,2023-01-30,,ahead-of-print,ahead-of-print,1-16,Closed,Article,"Liang, Guiqin; Jiang, Chunsong; Ping, Qiuzhe; Jiang, Xinyi","Liang, Guiqin (College of Information Science and Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, People’s Republic of China; College of Information and Communication, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, People’s Republic of China); Jiang, Chunsong (College of Civil and Architecture Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, People’s Republic of China); Ping, Qiuzhe (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, People’s Republic of China); Jiang, Xinyi (College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guilin University of Technology, Guilin, People’s Republic of China)","Jiang, Chunsong (Guilin University of Technology)","Liang, Guiqin (Guilin University of Technology; Guilin University of Electronic Technology); Jiang, Chunsong (Guilin University of Technology); Ping, Qiuzhe (Guilin University of Technology); Jiang, Xinyi (Guilin University of Technology)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154966633,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4608 Human-Centred Computing,4 Quality Education

Modeling is integral for both automation design in programming education and communication in the collaborative process. This study investigates the effect of learning orientation on the modeling stage based on gender. The study includes 756 male and 688 female elementary-school students. We analyzed the results of XGBOOST by extracting the influential characteristics from feature selection along with the basic statistics. As a result of the study, it was confirmed that learners, regardless of gender, had the largest gap in modeling and that this was the stage at which differences occurred in programming education. For male students, the process of collecting data for modeling or devising a solution was found to be an important learning method. This shows that it is necessary to create an environment to focus on activities that derive solutions from the collected data along with strengthening information retrieval education. Although female students showed a similar tendency to male students, the process of cooperating with friends as a differentiating factor was found to be an important learning method. It seems necessary to apply teaching and learning methods that can strengthen team projects that can collaborate with friends.

Design/methodology/approach Cross-sectional data from five surveys between 2013 and 2020 (N = 1,578) among the undergraduates of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, a private university in Kampar Malaysia, were combined. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 was used to screen for depression. Cochran’s Armitage test was used to detect trend in depression. Logistic regression, random forest regression and extra gradient boosting regression were used to identify risk factors and classification.   Findings The prevalence of depressive symptoms was found to be between 26.4% and 36.8% between the years with an average of 29.9%. There was no significant time trend in the prevalence. The risk of depressive symptoms was higher among female students, those who were dependent on family for financial support and those who were stressed.   Practical implications Periodical screening for depression is warranted for the identification of students at risk for depression.

Students are facing various difficulties in courses like “Programming” and “Data Structures” through undergraduate programs, which is why failure and dropout rates in these courses are high. Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students’ data gathered from various educational settings to predict students’ academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students’ academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students’ academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor. In addition, we made a comparison between various resampling methods to solve the imbalanced dataset problem, such as SMOTE, ADASYN, ROS, and SMOTE-ENN. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students’ performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89%, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.",,,IEEE Access,,,,2021-01-01,2021,2021-10-13,2021-01-01,9,,140731-140746,All OA; Gold,Article,"Nabil, Aya; Seyam, Mohammed; Abou-Elfetouh, Ahmed","Nabil, Aya (Department of Information Systems, Faculty of Computers and Information Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt); Seyam, Mohammed (Department of Information Systems, Faculty of Computers and Information Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt); Abou-Elfetouh, Ahmed (Department of Information Systems, Faculty of Computers and Information Science, Mansoura University, Mansoura, 35516, Egypt)","Nabil, Aya (Mansoura University)","Nabil, Aya (Mansoura University); Seyam, Mohammed (Mansoura University); Abou-Elfetouh, Ahmed (Mansoura University)",24,24,,14.63,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/6514899/09568875.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141852895,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,4 Quality Education

As a three-person imperfect information game in China, DouDiZhu not only has competitive relationship but also has cooperative relationship between the players, which makes the model more complicated, hence it has high research value. In this paper, the DouDiZhu's playing strategy is converted into 182 legal playing multi-classification problems, by extracting the characteristics of winning data of different players, using the XGBoost model and setting reasonable model parameters. In addition, to make the strategy of playing cards more reasonable through phased training, character training, and rule correction methods.

It is advantageous in evaluating the student’s learning outcomes because it gives them the chance to exhibit their knowledge and skills freely. For these reasons, a lot of researchers turned their interest in Automated essay scoring (AES) is one of the most remarkable innovations in text mining using Natural Language Processing and Machine learning algorithms. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated essay scoring that uses ontology and Natural Language Processing. Different learning algorithms showed agreeing prediction outcomes but still regression algorithm with the proper features incorporated with it may produce more accurate essay score. This study aims to increase the accuracy, reliability and validity of the AES by implementing the Gradient ridge regression with the domain ontology and other features. Linear regression, linear lasso regression and ridge regression were also used in conjunction with the different features that was extracted. The different features extracted are the domain concepts, average word length, orthography (spelling mistakes), grammar and sentiment score. The first dataset used is the ASAP dataset from Kaggle website is used to train and test different machine learning algorithms that is consist of linear regression, linear lasso regression, ridge regression and gradient boosting regression together with the different features identified. The second dataset used is the one extracted from the student’s essay exam in Human Computer Interaction course. The results show that the Gradient Boosting Regression has the highest variance and kappa scores. However, we can tell that there are similarities when it comes to performances for Linear, Ridge and Lasso regressions due to the dataset used which is ASAP. Furthermore, the results were evaluated using Cohen Weighted Kappa (CWA) score and compared the agreement between the human raters. The CWA result is 0.659 that can be interpreted as Strong level of agreement between the Human Grader and the automated essay score. Therefore, the proposed AES has 64-81% reliability level.",,,International Journal of Engineering and Advanced Technology,,,,2019-10-30,2019,2019-10-30,,9,1,2448-2457,All OA; Gold,Article,"Contreras*, Jennifer; Hilles, Shadi; Abubakar, Zainab Binti","Contreras*, Jennifer (); Hilles, Shadi (); Abubakar, Zainab Binti ()",,"Contreras*, Jennifer (); Hilles, Shadi (); Abubakar, Zainab Binti ()",2,2,,0.68,https://doi.org/10.35940/ijeat.a9974.109119,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122540164,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,4 Quality Education

In this paper, tree-based machine learning algorithms are used to predict students’ overall academic performance in their bachelor’s program. The transcript data of the students in the same department in a Chinese university were collected. All the courses in the bachelor’s program were then divided into six typical categories, and the mean GPAs of each category were taken as primary input features for prediction. Three tree-based machine learning models were established, i.e. decision tree (DT), Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and random forest (RF). Results show that we can successfully identify more than 80% of the students at low-performance risk using the RF model at the end of the second semester, which is meaningful because the global quality of teaching and learning of the department can be improved by taking targeted measures in time according to the machine learning model. Feature importance and the structure of decision tree were also analyzed to extract knowledge that is valuable for both students and teachers.

Here, a procedure is demonstrated that classifies passengers (Adult, Child/Student, and Senior Citizen) based on their three-month travel patterns. The method proceeds by constructing distinct commuter matrices, we refer to as eigentravel matrices, that capture a commuter's characteristic travel routine. Comparing various classification models, we show that the gradient boosting method gives the best prediction with 76% accuracy, 81% better than the minimum model accuracy (42%) computed using proportional chance criterion. The models are verified and validated; consequently, the procedure demonstrated should serve as a benchmark for problems of this type. The generally intuitive pattern of the demographic classification also points to a possible universal ‘travelprint’ of commuters, and can inspire development of unsupervised machine learning methods for automated fare collection systems that do not provide additional demographic detail.","We would like to thank the Land Transport Authority of Singapore for the ticketing data used in this work, Nasri bin Othman for his assistance in preparing the datasets; Zhenzhou Wu and Jesus Felix Valenzuela for their valuable feedback on the work.",This research was supported by Singapore ASERC Complex Systems Programme research grant (1224504056).,Transportmetrica B Transport Dynamics,,,,2017-02-28,2017,2017-02-28,2018-07-03,6,3,230-250,Closed,Article,"Legara, Erika Fille T.; Monterola, Christopher P.","Legara, Erika Fille T.

We discuss three methods: logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting (GB). We used the KDD cup 2015 dataset. Since our dataset is unbalanced, a sampling technique called synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used. Six models are then obtained, for each model we used a grid search cross-validation to find which are the parameters that optimize the mapping function according to the accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC ROC) score. In order to validate our scores, we used the 10-fold cross-validation technique. Our findings show that ensemble machine-learning methods produce better results than basic machine-learning methods. The obtained results have proved that the extracted features and the used techniques are able to predict the drop-out with high efficiency. These relevant models were used with autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) model for time series data to detect the student at high risk of drop-out in earlier weeks of the course.

Existing studies mainly focus on mining students' problem-solving skills or behavior patterns and intervening in students' learning processes according to this information in the late course. However, educators often expect to improve the learning outcome in a proactive manner through dynamically designing instructional strategies prior to a course that are more appropriate to students' average ability. Therefore, in this article, we propose a two-stage problem-solving ability modeling approach to obtain students' ability in different learning stages, including the pre-problem-solving ability model and the post-problem-solving ability model. The models are trained with Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) on the historical event logs of the prerequisite course and the target course, respectively. With the premodel, we establish the students' pre-problem-solving ability profiles that reflect their average knowledge level before starting a course. Then, the instructional design is dynamically chosen according to the profiles. After a course completes, the post-problem-solving ability profiles are generated by the postmodel to analyze the learning outcome and prompt the learning feedback, in order to complete the closed-loop teaching process. We study the modeling of coding ability in computer programming education to show our teaching strategy. The experimental results show that the generalizable problem-solving ability models yield high classification precision, while most students' abilities have been significantly improved by the proposed approach at the end of the course.",,This work was supported in part by the Research Project on Undergraduate Teaching Reform of Liaoning Province under Grant 2022-160 and in part by the Undergraduate Education Reform Funding of Shenyang Aerospace University under Grant JG202202C.,IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies,,,,2022-10-25,2022,2022-10-25,,15,6,709-719,Closed,Article,"Liu, Fang; Zhao, Liang; Zhao, Jiayi; Dai, Qin; Fan, Chunlong; Shen, Jun","Liu, Fang (School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, 110136, China); Zhao, Liang (School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, 110136, China); Zhao, Jiayi (School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, 110136, China; Tencent Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, 518052, China); Dai, Qin (College of Information, Shenyang Institute of Engineering, Shenyang, 110136, China); Fan, Chunlong (School of Computer Science, Shenyang Aerospace University, Shenyang, 110136, China); Shen, Jun (School of Computing and Information Technology, Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW, 2522, Australia)","Zhao, Liang (Shenyang Aerospace University)","Liu, Fang (Shenyang Aerospace University); Zhao, Liang (Shenyang Aerospace University); Zhao, Jiayi (Shenyang Aerospace University); Dai, Qin (Shenyang Institute of Engineering); Fan, Chunlong (Shenyang Aerospace University); Shen, Jun (University of Wollongong)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152236112,39 Education; 3901 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 46 Information and Computing Sciences,4 Quality Education

Accordingly, it is of great significance to understand the performance of TBM and minimize the related risks in the operation process of TBM. The purpose of this research is to propose a new hybrid model for TBM performance prediction (like penetration rate, PR) based on the improved sparrow search algorithm-gradient boosting regression tree technique (ISSA-GBRT). Improving the accuracy of GBRT by improving the SSA algorithm based on chaotic sine map and Student t-distribution mutation is the main advantage of this model. For comparison, other hybrid models based on GBRT were applied and proposed, namely, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-GBRT, biogeography-based optimization (BBO)-GBRT, and sparrow search algorithm (SSA)-GBRT. To do so, a Chinese case study, the Shenzhen Metro Line 10 tunnel, was used to validate the developed models, and 80% of the total samples were randomly chosen as the training set, while the remaining 20% of the samples were used to test the models. To compare the results calculated from the model, two evaluation indicators, correlation coefficients (R) and root mean square error (RMSE), were computed.

Using machine learning tools for the early identification of students at risk of dropping out has gained a lot of interest recently. However, there has been little discussion on dropout prediction using interpretable machine learning (IML) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools.In this work, using the data of a large public Hungarian university, we demonstrate how IML and XAI tools can support educational stakeholders in dropout prediction. We show that complex machine learning models – such as the CatBoost classifier – can efficiently identify at-risk students relying solely on pre-enrollment achievement measures, however, they lack interpretability. Applying IML tools, such as permutation importance (PI), partial dependence plot (PDP), LIME, and SHAP values, we demonstrate how the predictions can be explained both globally and locally. Explaining individual predictions opens up great opportunities for personalized intervention, for example by offering the right remedial courses or tutoring sessions. Finally, we present the results of a user study that evaluates whether higher education stakeholders find these tools interpretable and useful.","We are extremely grateful to Bálint Csabay and Mihály Szabó, the colleagues of the Central Academic Office of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, who helped us with data collection and data understanding.","Open access funding provided by Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

666,pub.1144539387,10.3390/bdcc6010006,,,On Developing Generic Models for Predicting Student Outcomes in Educational Data Mining,"Poor academic performance of students is a concern in the educational sector, especially if it leads to students being unable to meet minimum course requirements. However, with timely prediction of students’ performance, educators can detect at-risk students, thereby enabling early interventions for supporting these students in overcoming their learning difficulties. However, the majority of studies have taken the approach of developing individual models that target a single course while developing prediction models. These models are tailored to specific attributes of each course amongst a very diverse set of possibilities. While this approach can yield accurate models in some instances, this strategy is associated with limitations. In many cases, overfitting can take place when course data is small or when new courses are devised. Additionally, maintaining a large suite of models per course is a significant overhead. This issue can be tackled by developing a generic and course-agnostic predictive model that captures more abstract patterns and is able to operate across all courses, irrespective of their differences. This study demonstrates how a generic predictive model can be developed that identifies at-risk students across a wide variety of courses. Experiments were conducted using a range of algorithms, with the generic model producing an effective accuracy. The findings showed that the CatBoost algorithm performed the best on our dataset across the F-measure, ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve and AUC scores; therefore, it is an excellent candidate algorithm for providing solutions on this domain given its capabilities to seamlessly handle categorical and missing data, which is frequently a feature in educational datasets.",,This research received no external funding.,Big Data and Cognitive Computing,,,,2022-01-07,2022,2022-01-07,,6,1,6,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ramaswami, Gomathy; Susnjak, Teo; Mathrani, Anuradha","Ramaswami, Gomathy (); Susnjak, Teo (); Mathrani, Anuradha ()","Ramaswami, Gomathy ","Ramaswami, Gomathy (); Susnjak, Teo (); Mathrani, Anuradha ()",11,11,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2504-2289/6/1/6/pdf?version=1641815423,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144539387,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

However, placement of students into the appropriate university, college, or discipline is of paramount importance for university education to perform its role. In this study, various explainable machine learning approaches (Decision Tree [DT], Extra tree classifiers [ETC], Random forest [RF] classifiers, Gradient boosting classifiers [GBC], and Support Vector Machine [SVM]) were tested to predict students’ right undergraduate major (field of specialization) before admission at the undergraduate level based on the current job markets and experience. The DT classifier predicts the target class based on simple decision rules. ETC is an ensemble learning technique that builds prediction models by using unpruned decision trees. RF is also an ensemble technique that uses many individual DTs to solve complex problems. GBC classifiers and produce strong prediction models. SVM predicts the target class with a high margin, as compared to other classifiers. The imbalanced dataset includes secondary school marks, higher secondary school marks, experience, and salary to select specialization for students in undergraduate programs. The results showed that the performances of RF and GBC predict the student field of specialization (undergraduate major) before admission, as well as the fact that these measures are as good as DT and ETC. Statistical analysis (Spearman correlation) is also applied to evaluate the relationship between a student’s major and other input variables. The statistical results show that higher student marks in higher secondary (hsc_p), university degree (Degree_p), and entry test (etest_p) play an important role in the student’s area of specialization, and we can recommend study fields according to these features. Based on these results, RF and GBC can easily be integrated into intelligent recommender systems to suggest a good field of specialization to university students, according to the current job market. This study also demonstrates that marks in higher secondary and university and entry tests are useful criteria to suggest the right undergraduate major because these input features most accurately predict the student field of specialization.","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deputyship for Research &amp; Innovation, Ministry of Education in Saudi Arabia for funding this research work through the project number IFPIP:536-830-1442 and King Abdulaziz University, DSR, Jeddah, Saud Arabia.",This research work is funded under the project number IFPIP:536-830-1442.,Applied Sciences,,,,2021-11-11,2021,2021-11-11,,11,22,10639,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alsayed, Alhuseen Omar; Rahim, Mohd Shafry Mohd; AlBidewi, Ibrahim; Hussain, Mushtaq; Jabeen, Syeda Huma; Alromema, Nashwan; Hussain, Sadiq; Jibril, Muhammad Lawan","Alsayed, Alhuseen Omar (Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia;, shafry@utm.my; Deanship of Scientific Research, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia); Rahim, Mohd Shafry Mohd (Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor Bahru 81310, Johor, Malaysia;, shafry@utm.my); AlBidewi, Ibrahim (Department of Information Technology, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia;, ialbidewi@kau.edu.sa); Hussain, Mushtaq (Department of Computer Science and Information Technology, Virtual University of Pakistan, Lahore 54000, Pakistan;, mushtaq.hussain@vu.edu.pk); Jabeen, Syeda Huma (Brainnettom Center, Institute of Automation, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China;, hjabeen2@gmail.com); Alromema, Nashwan (Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology in Rabigh (FCITR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia;, nalromema@kau.edu.sa); Hussain, Sadiq (Examination Branch, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh 786004, India;, sadiq@dibru.ac.in); Jibril, Muhammad Lawan (Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Kashere, Barri 771103, Gombe State, Nigeria;, lawan.jibril@fukashere.edu.ng)","Alsayed, Alhuseen Omar (University of Technology Malaysia; King Abdulaziz University)","Alsayed, Alhuseen Omar (University of Technology Malaysia; King Abdulaziz University); Rahim, Mohd Shafry Mohd (University of Technology Malaysia); AlBidewi, Ibrahim (King Abdulaziz University); Hussain, Mushtaq (Virtual University of Pakistan); Jabeen, Syeda Huma (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Alromema, Nashwan (King Abdulaziz University); Hussain, Sadiq (Dibrugarh University); Jibril, Muhammad Lawan (Federal University Kashere)",7,7,,4.27,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/22/10639/pdf?version=1636696751,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143148983,39 Education; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,

With the rise in blended learning, both online and offline, students need to further improve their online learning effectiveness. Therefore, predicting students’ performance and identifying students who are struggling in real time to intervene is an important way to improve learning outcomes. However, currently, machine learning in grade prediction applications typically only employs a single-output prediction method and has lagging issues. To advance the prediction of time and enhance the predictive attributes, as well as address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a multi-output hybrid ensemble model that utilizes data from the Superstar Learning Communication Platform (SLCP) to predict grades. Experimental results show that using the first six weeks of SLCP data and the Xgboost model to predict mid-term and final grades meant that accuracy reached 78.37%, which was 3–8% higher than the comparison models. Using the Gdbt model to predict homework and experiment grades, the average mean squared error was 16.76, which is better than the comparison models.

The area of communication engineering deals with different components including, wireless mobile services, radio, broadband, web and satellites. There is a rapid decline in the quality of students produced by engineering faculties as a result of sufficient and quality methods and frameworks of student assessment. The production of high-potential engineers is limited by the utilization of old and traditional education methodology and frameworks. The student presentation estimation system in engineering institution is a motionless manual. Usually, the assessment of student’s performance using the traditional system is limited to the use of students’ performance scores, while failing to evaluate their performance based on activities or practical applications. In addition, such systems do not take cognizance of individual knowledge of students that connects to different activities within the learning environment. Recently, engineering institutions have started paying attention to evaluation solutions that are based on wireless networks and Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, in this study, an automated system has been proposed for the assessment of engineering students. The proposed system is designed based on IoT and wireless communication networks with the aim of improving the process of virtual education. The data used in this study has been collected through the use of different IoT sensors within the premises of the college, and pre-processed using normalization. After the data was pre-processed, it was stored in cloud. In order to enable the classification of student’s activity, an Adaptive Layered Bayesian Belief Network (AL-BBN) classifier is proposed in this work. The student’s scores have been calculated using fuzzy logic, while Multi-Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (MGBDT) was proposed for decision making. The use of python simulation tool is employed in the implementation of the proposed system, and the evaluation of the performance benchmarks was done as well.

To solve this problem, the purpose of the study is to develop and experimentally prove the effectiveness of using a program for predicting the employment of students of a pedagogical university based on the introduction of various machine learning algorithms. Using a random selection of students, the collection and processing of their questionnaires (n=205) in 2011-2016 were carried out. Various machine learning algorithms were used to create the program: decision trees, logistic regression, and catboost. In the course of the experiment, the data of the questionnaires were loaded into the program for its training according to various algorithms, in order to ultimately obtain a finished intellectual product with the ability to predict the employment of graduates. In the final comparison, the program developed on the “decision trees” algorithm made only 2 out 19 questionnaires and 7 out 61, which was the best result - 89%.

Their career and academic tenure were not affected as contrary to the past pandemics throughout world history. All this has been possible through long sessions of classes, quizzes, assignments, discussions, chat interactions, and examinations through online video-based learning using computer interactive measures. The students were privileged to utilize digital technologies for longer durations for learning purposes. However, these long stretches have adversely affected their body postures, and physical and mental health as they majorly remain confined to chairs with restricted levels of physical activities. Thus, there is a need to have a model which can act as an insight for parents, doctors (pediatricians), and academic policymakers to decide on maximum hours for online teaching and related activities during future pandemics. The novel model proposed in this work helps to predict the impact of enhanced students’ computer interactions on their physical and mental health. The method proposed uses a novel model which is advanced and computationally strong. The model follows a two-step methodology, where at the first level, a variant of already existing machine learning algorithm is proposed and at the next level, it is optimized further using a hybrid bio-inspired optimization algorithm. The model consists of proposing a variant of XGBoost model (step1 optimization) followed by a hybrid bio-inspired algorithm (step2 optimization). The work considers a humongous dataset with varied age groups of students with more than 10 attributes. The proposed model is highly efficient in making predictions with 98.07% accuracy level and 98.43% F1-score. The time complexity of the model obtained is also of order of “n” where “n” depicts the number of input variables. Strong empirical results for other parameters also like specificity (95.63%) and sensitivity (96.74%) ascertain the enhanced predictive power generated using the proposed model. An extensive comparative study with other machine learning models ascertains the elevated accuracy and predictive power using the proposed model.

It helps to identify areas where students need additional support or challenge and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction, make important decisions such as on student placement and curriculum development, and monitor the quality of education. Evaluating student knowledge assessment is essential to measuring student progress, informing instruction, and providing feedback to improve student performance and enhance the overall teaching and learning experience. This research paper is designed to create a machine learning (ML)-based system that assesses student performance and knowledge throughout the course of their studies and pinpoints the key variables that have the most significant effects on that performance and expertise. Additionally, it describes the impact of running models with data that only contains key features on their performance. To classify the students, the paper employs seven different classifiers, including support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This paper carries out two experiments to see how best to replicate the automatic classification of student knowledge. In the first experiment, the dataset (Dataset 1) was used in its original state, including all five properties listed in the dataset, to evaluate the performance indicators. In the second experiment, the least correlated variable was removed from the dataset to create a smaller dataset (Dataset 2), and the same set of performance indicators was evaluated. Then, the performance indicators using Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 were compared. The GBM exhibited the highest prediction accuracy of 98%, according to Dataset 1. In terms of prediction error, the GBM also performed well. The accuracy of optimistic forecasts on student performance, denoted as the performance indicator ‘precision’, was highest in GBM at 99%, while DT, RF, and SVM were 98% accurate in their optimistic forecasts for Dataset 1. The second experiment’s findings demonstrated that practically no classifiers showed appreciable improvements in prediction accuracy with a reduced feature set in Dataset 2. It showed that the time required for related learning objects and the knowledge level corresponding to a goal learning object have less impact.","The authors extend their appreciation to Researchers Supporting Project number (RSPD2023R608), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.","This research is funded by: Researchers supporting Project number (RSPD2023R608), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",Sustainability,,,,2023-04-04,2023,2023-04-04,,15,7,6229,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alruwais, Nuha; Zakariah, Mohammed","Alruwais, Nuha (Department of Computer Science and Engineering, College of Applied Studies and Community Services, King Saud University, P.O.

As a result, a tremendous amount of data is generated and stored on MOOCs online learning platforms. In any case, this data should be effectively transformed into knowledge, thus providing valuable feedback to learners, and enhancing decision making practices in the educational field. Despite the benefits and learning prospects that MOOCs offer to learners, there is a considerable divergence between enrollment and completion rates. In this context, the main scope of this study is to exploit predictive analytics and explainable artificial intelligence for the early prediction of student certification in a 11-week MOOC for smart cities, namely DevOps. A plethora of Machine Learning models were built employing familiar classification algorithms. The experimental results revealed that the models based on Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression and Light Gradient Boosted Machine classifiers prevailed in terms of Accuracy, Area Under Curve, Recall, Precision, F1-score, Kappa, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient, getting a predictive accuracy of 94.41% at the end of the second week of the course. Therefore, students who are less likely to obtain a certificate could be envisaged at an early enough stage to provide sufficient support actions and targeted intervention strategies to them.

This paper takes the cross-sectional data of the employment of graduates from a financial and economic university in 2020 as the sample; whether the actual starting salary is a high salary as the dependent variable; and human capital, social capital, labor market as the explanatory variables and uses R to establish a logistic regression model to analyze the determinants of the high salary of graduates. Five machine learning methods, SVM, naive Bayes, CART, random forest, and XGBoost, are used to predict whether graduates can get a high starting salary, compare the advantages and disadvantages of various methods horizontally, optimize the parameters at the same time, and further enhance the performance of the model. Based on the employment data of graduate students in a university of finance and economics in 2020, this paper makes an empirical study. The study shows that academic qualifications, professional disciplines, employment regions, employment industries, the nature of employment units, gender, and whether they have served as student cadres have a significant impact on whether graduates can get “high salaries.” The main factors affecting the starting salary of graduates are the accumulation of human capital and social capital, but the segmentation of labor market is also the main reason affecting the starting salary of graduates. The prediction results of several models show that the integrated models have better performance than single models, and the XGBoost model is the best, which can help predict whether graduates get high salary.",This work was supported by the Key Laboratory of Financial Intelligence and Financial Engineering of Sichuan Province.,,Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing,,Kuruva Lakshmanna,,2022-07-26,2022,,2022-07-26,2022,,1-14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Ping; Liao, Wensheng; Zhao, Zhongping; Miu, Feng","Wang, Ping (School of Economic Information Engineering, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China, swufe.edu.cn; The Key Laboratory of Financial Intelligence and Financial Engineering of Sichuan Province, China); Liao, Wensheng (School of Economic Information Engineering, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China, swufe.edu.cn); Zhao, Zhongping (Student Career Planning and Career Guidance Center, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China, swufe.edu.cn); Miu, Feng (School of Artificial Intelligence and Law, Southwest University of Political Science & Law, Chongqing, China, swupl.edu.cn)","Miu, Feng (Southwest University of Political Science & Law)","Wang, Ping (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics); Liao, Wensheng (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics); Zhao, Zhongping (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics); Miu, Feng (Southwest University of Political Science & Law)",1,1,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2022/7845545.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149770437,40 Engineering; 4006 Communications Engineering; 4008 Electrical Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4606 Distributed Computing and Systems Software,

Further, it is important to identify student who are at risk of failing to complete the course on time. The existing models applied machine learning approach for solving it. However, these models are not efficient as they are trained using legacy data and also failed to address imbalanced data issues for both training and testing the classification approach. Further, they are not efficient for classifying new courses. For overcoming these research challenges, this work presented a novel design by training the learning model for identifying risk using current courses.

592,pub.1151841027,10.3390/math10203758,,,Exploring Online Activities to Predict the Final Grade of Student,"Student success rate is a significant indicator of the quality of the educational services offered at higher education institutions (HEIs). It allows students to make their plans to achieve the set goals and helps teachers to identify the at-risk students and make timely interventions. University decision-makers need reliable data on student success rates to formulate specific and coherent decisions to improve students’ academic performance. In recent years, EDM has become an effective tool for exploring data from student activities to predict their final grades. This study presents a case study for predicting the students’ final grades based on their activities in Moodle Learning Management System (LMS) and attendance in online lectures conducted via Zoom by applying statistical and machine learning techniques. The data set consists of the final grades for 105 students who study Object-Oriented Programming at the University of Plovdiv during the 2021–2022 year, data for their activities in the online course (7057 records), and attendance to lectures (738). The predictions are based on 46 attributes. The Chi-square test is utilized to assess the association between students’ final grades and event context (lectures, source code, exercise, and assignment) and the relationships between attendance at lectures and final results. The logistic regression model is utilized to assess the actual impact of event context on “Fail” students in a multivariate setup. Four machine learning algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, and SVM) are applied using 70% of training data and 30% of test data to predict the students’ final grades. Five-fold cross validation was also utilized. The results show correlations between the students’ final grades and their activity in the online course and between students’ final grades and attendance at lectures. All applied machine learning algorithms performed moderately well predicting the students’ final results, as the Random Forest algorithm obtained the highest prediction accuracy—78%. The findings of the study clearly show that the Random Forest algorithm may be used to predict which students will fail after eight weeks. Such data-driven predictions are significant for teachers and decision-makers and allow them to take measures to reduce the number of failed students and identify which types of learning resources or student activities are better predictors of the student’s academic performance.",,The paper is partly supported by the project MU21-FTF-018 “Application of big data analysis methods in higher education” of the Scientific Research Fund at the University of Plovdiv “Paisii Hilendarski”.,Mathematics,,,,2022-10-12,2022,2022-10-12,,10,20,3758,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gaftandzhieva, Silvia; Talukder, Ashis; Gohain, Nisha; Hussain, Sadiq; Theodorou, Paraskevi; Salal, Yass Khudheir; Doneva, Rositsa","Gaftandzhieva, Silvia (Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Plovdiv “Paisii Hilendarski”, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria); Talukder, Ashis (Statistics Discipline, Khulna University, Khulna 9208, Bangladesh); Gohain, Nisha (Directorate of Open and Distance Learning, Dibrugarh University, Assam 786004, India); Hussain, Sadiq (Examination Branch, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh 786004, India); Theodorou, Paraskevi (Department of Digital Systems, University of Piraeus, Piraeus 18534, Greece); Salal, Yass Khudheir (Department of Computer Science, South Ural State University, 454080 Chelyabinsk, Russia); Doneva, Rositsa (Faculty of Physics and Technology, University of Plovdiv “Paisii Hilendarski”, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria)","Hussain, Sadiq (Dibrugarh University)","Gaftandzhieva, Silvia (Plovdiv University); Talukder, Ashis (Khulna University); Gohain, Nisha (Dibrugarh University); Hussain, Sadiq (Dibrugarh University); Theodorou, Paraskevi (University of Piraeus); Salal, Yass Khudheir (South Ural State University); Doneva, Rositsa (Plovdiv University)",5,5,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/20/3758/pdf?version=1666684520,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151841027,49 Mathematical Sciences,4 Quality Education

Depression has been found to be prevalent among youths and influences a person’s lifestyle and thought process. Unfortunately, due to the public and social stigma attached to this disease, the mental health issue of individuals are often overlooked. Early diagnosis of patients who may have depression often helps to provide effective treatment. This research aims to develop mechanisms to detect and predict depression levels and was applied to university students in Bangladesh. In this work, a questionnaire containing 106 questions has been constructed. The questions in the questionnaire are primarily of two kinds – (i) personal, and (ii) clinical. The questionnaire was distributed amongst Bangladeshi students and a total of 684 responses (aged between 19 and 35) were obtained. After appropriate consents from the participants, they were allowed to take the survey. After carefully scrutinizing the responses, 520 samples were taken into final consideration. A hybrid depression assessment scale was developed using a voting algorithm that employs eight well-known existing scales to assess the depression level of an individual. This hybrid scale was then applied to the collected samples that comprise personal information and questions from various familiar depression measuring scales. In addition, ten machine learning and two deep learning models were applied to predict the three classes of depression (normal, moderate and extreme). Five hyperparameter optimizers and nine feature selection methods were employed to improve the predictability. Accuracies of 98.08%, 94.23%, and 92.31% were obtained using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and CNN models, respectively. Random Forest accomplished the lowest false negatives and highest F Measure with its optimized hyperparameters.

It enables students to identify weaknesses and improve self-regulation. However, studies show this to be an area of great dissatisfaction in higher education. With ever-growing course participation numbers, delivering effective feedback is becoming an increasingly challenging task. The efficacy of feedback will depend on four levels of feedback; namely, feedback about the self, task, process or self-regulation. Hence, this paper explores the use of automated content analysis to examine feedback provided by instructors for feedback practices measured on self, task, process, and self-regulation levels. For this purpose, four binary XGBoost classifiers were trained and evaluated, one for each level of feedback. The results indicate effective classification performance on self, task, and process levels with accuracy values of 0.87, 0.82, and 0.69, respectively. Additionally, inter-language transferability of feedback features is measured using cross-language classification performance and feature importance analysis.

Learners’ interaction and study practice (quizzing, reading, exams) can be analyzed in order to get some insights into the student’s learning style, study schedule, knowledge, and performance. Quizzing might be used to help to create individualized/personalized spaced repetition algorithm in order to improve long-term retention of knowledge and provide efficient learning in online learning platforms. Current spaced repetition algorithms have pre-defined repetition rules and parameters that might not be a good fit for students’ different learning styles in online platforms. This study uses different machine learning models and a rich context model to analyze quizzing and reading records from e-learning platform called Hypocampus in order to get some insights into the relevant features to predict learning outcome (quiz answers). By knowing the answer correctness, a learning system might be able to recommend personalized repetitive schedule for questions with maximizing long-term memory retention. Study results show that question difficulty level and incorrectly answered previous questions are useful features to predict the correctness of student’s answer.

In order to overcome these shortcomings of the AFM virtual laboratory, we present a virtual AFM imaging system with a lower-resolution contact mode. We restore the core principle of the beam deflection method in AFM using the unity3D development platform. Several machine learning techniques are employed to build an imaging prediction model. Since no public dataset is available for the task of prediction of topographical maps, we create the first dataset of grating samples for prediction. The result indicates that the proposed topographical map prediction model with the best performance is CatBoost. We prove the feasibility of building a virtual AFM imaging system with the ability to visualize internal structures and predict sample topographical maps. This work has important applications related to the 3D dynamic display of the AFM scanning and imaging process and user experience training. At the same time, it can help users get a preliminary understanding of the imaging effect of different types of experimental samples under AFM, providing a new idea for the construction of AFM virtual laboratories.",,,Journal of Physics Conference Series,,,,2023-08-01,2023,,2023-08-01,2558,1,012033,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yang, Jinxin; Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Xuwei; Yuan, Lixin","Yang, Jinxin (International Research Centre for Nano Handling and Manufacturing of China, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Cross-Scale Micro and Nano Manufacturing, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China; Centre for Opto/Bio-Nano Measurement and Manufacturing, Zhongshan Institute of Changchun University of Science and Technology, Zhongshan 528437, China); Xu, Hongmei (International Research Centre for Nano Handling and Manufacturing of China, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Cross-Scale Micro and Nano Manufacturing, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China); Liu, Xuwei (International Research Centre for Nano Handling and Manufacturing of China, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Cross-Scale Micro and Nano Manufacturing, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China); Yuan, Lixin (International Research Centre for Nano Handling and Manufacturing of China, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Cross-Scale Micro and Nano Manufacturing, Changchun University of Science and Technology, Changchun 130022, China)",,"Yang, Jinxin (Changchun University of Science and Technology; Changchun University of Science and Technology; Changchun University of Science and Technology); Xu, Hongmei (Changchun University of Science and Technology; Changchun University of Science and Technology); Liu, Xuwei (Changchun University of Science and Technology; Changchun University of Science and Technology); Yuan, Lixin (Changchun University of Science and Technology; Changchun University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2558/1/012033,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163160202,51 Physical Sciences,

Most of the studies on indoor air quality in university settings largely focus merely on the measurement of parameters like temperature, humidity, C O 2 and P M 2.5 , etc., primarily dealing with perception-based study. Moreover, existing works consider installation of sensors in each and every lecture hall which incurs huge cost, hence may not be feasible for many Universities in low and medium economy countries. This paper proposes IndoAirSense, a low-cost, effective framework for indoor air quality estimation and forecasting in the context of university classrooms. In contrast to the existing approaches, assuming similar ambient and structural features of classrooms, this work considers deploying suitably-calibrated low-cost sensors, in only a few selected classrooms of the building. Using the sensed parameters, we apply Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and eXtream Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBR) for real-time estimation of the air quality in other rooms without sensors. Finally, prediction of the air quality of the rooms are performed using LSTM-wf a modified Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model and we achieved accuracy of nearly 95% and 96% during estimation and forecasting, respectively. An experiment on 10 classrooms involving 28 instructors and 60 students for a period of 256 h (spanning 32 days) has been performed using the developed application. The system App recorded user feedback on the perceived air quality revealing nearly 76% three stars (high correlation with system results) and 15% two stars (medium correlation) reviews, which validates the effectiveness of our framework.","The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for constructive suggestions and insightful comments which greatly helped to improve the quality of the manuscript.

The set of data corpora includes: one collected by a crowdsourcing platform, essays of Russian students (RusPersonality), Gender Imitation corpus, and the corpora used at Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2017 (FIRE), containing texts from Facebook, Twitter and Reviews. We present the analysis of numerical experiments based on different features(morphological data, vector of character n-gram frequencies, LIWC and others) of input texts along with various machine learning models (neural networks, gradient boosting methods, CNN, LSTM, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest). Results of these experiments are compared with the results of FIRE competition to evaluate effects of multi-genre training. The presented results, obtained on a wide set of data-driven models, establish the accuracy level for the task to identify gender of a author of a Russian text in the multi-genre case.

A multilinear regression model is used in parallel with random forest, support vector machine, artificial neural network and extreme gradient boosting machine stacking ensemble implementations. Designing a hybrid analysis is intended where classical statistical analysis and artificial intelligence algorithms are blended to augment the ability to retain valuable conclusions and well-supported results. The machine learning algorithms attain a higher level of predictive ability. In addition, the stacking appropriateness increases as the base learner output correlation matrix determinant increases and the random forest feature importance empirical distributions are correlated with the structure of p-values and the statistical significance test ascertains of the multiple linear model. An information system that supports the nationwide education system should be designed and further structured to collect meaningful and precise data about the full range of academic achievement antecedents.

574,pub.1136623068,10.1007/s40593-021-00246-2,,,Towards Designing Profitable Courses: Predicting Student Purchasing Behaviour in MOOCs,"Since their ‘official’ emergence in 2012 (Gardner and Brooks 2018), massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been growing rapidly. They offer low-cost education for both students and content providers; however, currently there is a very low level of course purchasing (less than 1% of the total number of enrolled students on a given online course opt to purchase its certificate). The most recent literature on MOOCs focuses on identifying factors that contribute to student success, completion level and engagement. One of the MOOC platforms’ ultimate targets is to become self-sustaining, enabling partners to create revenues and offset operating costs. Nevertheless, analysing learners’ purchasing behaviour on MOOCs remains limited. Thus, this study aims to predict students purchasing behaviour and therefore a MOOCs revenue, based on the rich array of activity clickstream and demographic data from learners. Specifically, we compare how several machine learning algorithms, namely RandomForest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost and XGBoost can predict course purchasability using a large-scale data collection of 23 runs spread over 5 courses delivered by The University of Warwick between 2013 and 2017 via FutureLearn. We further identify the common representative predictive attributes that influence a learner’s certificate purchasing decisions. Our proposed model achieved promising accuracies, between 0.82 and 0.91, using only the time spent on each step. We further reached higher accuracy of 0.83 to 0.95, adding learner demographics (e.g. gender, age group, level of education, and country) which showed a considerable impact on the model’s performance. The outcomes of this study are expected to help design future courses and predict the profitability of future runs; it may also help determine what personalisation features could be provided to increase MOOC revenue.",The authors wish to thank The University of Warwick for providing access to their FutureLearn courses.,,International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education,,,,2021-03-23,2021,2021-03-23,2021-06,31,2,215-233,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Alshehri, Mohammad; Alamri, Ahmed; Cristea, Alexandra I.; Stewart, Craig D.","Alshehri, Mohammad (Department of Computer Science, Durham University, South Road, DH1 3LE, Durham, UK; Department of Management Information Systems, College of Business, University of Jeddah, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia); Alamri, Ahmed (Department of Computer Science, Durham University, South Road, DH1 3LE, Durham, UK; Department of Computer Science.

With the exponentially increasing crime rate, it has become a daunting task to prevent them at an evenly faster rate. Therefore, we have worked with several variables that are inextricably linked with adolescent offenses. The study identifies the causes of adolescent drug addiction by pinpointing the behavioral disorders and predicts their tendency of crime engagement. Using a dataset of both drug-addicted and non-addicted teens, the proposed approach predicts the latent connections to future under-aged crimes. The dataset was collected from four drug rehabilitation centers and high school students. To achieve better prediction, we have used multiple machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We have evaluated several performance parameters, namely accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score, and compared them in light of individual algorithms. The experimental results showed that MLPs algorithm outperformed others attaining 95.36% accuracy, whereas other algorithms achieved accuracies ranging from 89 to 94%. We have also extracted the best features by applying Univariate Feature Selection method and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method. The proffered estimation was explained by Shapley Additive explanation (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation (LIME) techniques.

Researchers are keen to predict the academic performance of students; this is done to enhance the overall productivity of educational system by effectively identifying students whose performance is below average. This universal concern has been combined with data science leading to the creation of an interdisciplinary research area called Educational Data Mining. One of the recent issues which has been addressed by researchers is training generalizable models from different aspects such as gender, major, geography and etc. Therefore, in this research we use machine learning methods to predict student's performance, emphasizing on training generalizable models from geographical aspect. For this purpose, a questionnaire containing 37 questions was designed, through which 536 answers were collected, including 111 international and 425 domestic answers. According to the literature, student performance is mostly determined based on the GPA (grade point average) of the entire course. In this research, information about the GPA of respondents in undergraduate and graduate courses was collected in the form of three classes. After a final review of the models employed in previous studies, the main models selected and used for classification purposes included SVM, CNN, Adaboost, RF, SVM, and DT. Feature selection is performed using XGBoost, random forest, as well as SVML1. The main issue investigated in this study is the generalizability of the models trained on domestic (iranian) data and tested on international data (non-iranian). Experimental results show that the best models trained with specific dataset collected in this research had generalizability comparing to base models’ outcomes which were trained and tested on domestic data. Meanwhile, Random forest and CNN models shows the best performance with the average of accuracy and F-score of 73.5 and 68.5, respectively.",Authors of this research are truly thankful of people anonymously participated in responding to the questionnaire provided in this research.,,Education and Information Technologies,,,,2023-04-03,2023,2023-04-03,,,,1-19,Closed,Article,"Parhizkar, Amirmohammad; Tejeddin, Golnaz; Khatibi, Toktam","Parhizkar, Amirmohammad (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran); Tejeddin, Golnaz (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran); Khatibi, Toktam (Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran)","Parhizkar, Amirmohammad (Tarbiat Modares University)","Parhizkar, Amirmohammad (Tarbiat Modares University); Tejeddin, Golnaz (Tarbiat Modares University); Khatibi, Toktam (Tarbiat Modares University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156907466,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,

The data set which is used in the study was taken from the archives of Turk-Stat. (Turkish Statistical Institute) and OSYM (Assessment, Selection and Placement Center) and MATLAB statistical software program was used. In order to evaluate Bagging and Boosting classification performances better, the success rates of the students were grouped into two groups. According to this, the provinces that were above the average were coded as 1, and the provinces below the average were coded as 0 and dependent variables were created. The Bagging and Boosting ensemble algorithms were run accordingly. In order to evaluate the prediction abilities of the Bagging and Boosting algorithms, the data set was divided into training and testing. For this purpose, while the data between 2010-2012 yearrs were used as training data, the data of the year 2013 were used as testing data. Accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure were used to demonstrate the performance of the methods in the study.

The e-learning methodology was established for the first time in the late 1990s, however, since the Covid-19 pandemic, it has established itself as the best alternative to traditional education, placing it as a benchmark worldwide. One of the concerns in the university environment where this study was carried out is to be able to determine the impact that virtual teaching has had compared to face-to-face teaching, since there are factors (gender, number of children, sex, age, type of study) that could influence the academic performance of students. Using the classification metrics within the comparative process, it was determined that among the implemented ML techniques, the XGBoost reached 78.4% accuracy, but was surpassed by the artificial neural network (ANN) that learned to predict with 82.4%. of accuracy. Due to the above, the use of the artificial neural network is recommended for the prediction of the academic performance of university students since, in addition, with its massive predictions can be made due to its high processing capacity.

Several challenges can arise in making an automatic short answer scoring system, one of which is the quantity and quality of the data. The data labeling process is not easy because it requires a human annotator who is an expert in their field. Further, the data imbalance process is also a challenge because the number of labels for correct answers is always much less than the wrong answers. In this paper, we propose the use of a stacking model based on neural network and XGBoost for classification process with sentence embedding feature.

A country’s prosperity depends, among other factors, on its ability to produce higher education graduates capable of moving a country forward. To alleviate the dropout problem, more and more institutions are turning to the possibilities that artificial intelligence can provide to predict dropout as early as possible. The difficulty of accessing personal data and privacy issues that it entails force the institutions to rely on the Academic Data of their students to create accurate and reliable predictive systems. This work focuses on creating the best possible predictive model based solely on academic data, and accordingly, its capacity to infer knowledge must be maximised.

Medical reports have shown that people with depression exhibit abnormal wave patterns in EEG signals compared with the healthy subjects when they are exposed to positive and negative stimuli. In this paper, we proposed an intelligent MDD detection model based on Fourier-Bessel series expansion (FBSE) coupled with domain adaptation (DA). First, EEG signals are segmented into intervals and each segment is passed through FBSE. Two types of features, including statistical and nonlinear features are investigated and extracted from each FBSE coefficient to detect MDD. Student t-test and Wilcoxon test are employed to remove noisy and bad features that can compromise the performance of data-driven learners. Then, DA method named Independence Domain Adaptation was applied to reduce the difference of feature distributions among subjects. The selected features are sent to a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM), and other classifiers named SVM, k-nearest (KNN), ransom forest, Bagged ensemble, boosted ensemble, decision tree, gradient boosting and stacked ensemble for the comparison purpose. Our experiments are simulated by using publicly available dataset. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated in both subject dependence experiment by 10-fold cross validation, subject independence experiment by leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, and Confidence interval respectively. Results showed that the features reduction method can significantly improve the mean accuracy by 4.20. The proposed model is compared with previous studies and the results show that the proposed model outperforms the other methods.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,,,,2023-08,2023,,2023-08,85,,104923,Closed,Article,"Mohammed, Hadeer; Diykh, Mohammed","Mohammed, Hadeer (University of Thi-Qar, College of Education for Pure Science, Iraq); Diykh, Mohammed (University of Thi-Qar, College of Education for Pure Science, Iraq; Information and Communication Technology Research Group, Scientific Research Centre, Al-Ayen University, Iraq; UniSQ College, University of Southern Queensland, QLD, Australia)","Diykh, Mohammed (; Al-Ayen University; University of Southern Queensland)","Mohammed, Hadeer (); Diykh, Mohammed (Al-Ayen University; University of Southern Queensland)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157252239,"30 Agricultural, Veterinary and Food Sciences; 3006 Food Sciences; 40 Engineering; 4003 Biomedical Engineering",

Automated essay scoring will be instrumental when the answer assessment process is on a large scale so that manual correction by humans can cause several problems. In 2019, the Ukara dataset was released for automatic essay scoring in the Indonesian language. The best model that has been published using the dataset produces an F1-score of 0.821 using pre-trained fastText sentence embedding and the stacking model between the neural network and XGBoost. In this study, we propose to use a simpler classifier model using a single hidden layer neural network but using a richer feature, namely BERT sentence embedding. Pre-trained model BERT sentence embedding extracts more information from sentences but has a smaller file size than fastText pre-trained model.

The primary data containing serum Vitamin D levels were collected from a total of 3044 college students between 18-21 years of age. The independent parameters like age, sex, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, body fat, bone mass, exercise, sunlight exposure, and milk consumption were used for prediction of VDD. The study aims to compare and evaluate different machine learning models in the prediction of severity in VDD. The objectives of our approach are to apply various powerful machine learning algorithms in prediction and evaluate the results with different performance measures like Precision, Recall, F1-measure, Accuracy, and Area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The McNemar’s test was conducted to validate the empirical results which is a statistical test. The final objective is to identify the best machine learning classifier in the prediction of the severity of VDD. The most popular and powerful machine learning classifiers like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), AdaBoost (AB), Bagging Classifier (BC), ExtraTrees (ET), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Gradient Boosting (GB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) were implemented to predict the severity of VDD.

It is possible to save numerous lives if biomarkers are used to assist medical providers in diagnosing their patients faster. Many researchers have been trying to identify the crucial biomarkers in the early diagnosis of diseases. This paper presents several steps divided into two phases for determining the most important metabolomic biomarkers in the blood for lung cancer prediction using Plasma and Serum samples. We used the Shapiro–Wilk Test, Bartlett’s Test, Levene’s Test, Student’s t-Test, and Kruskal–Wallis Test in the first phase to determine the potential biomarkers. Recursive Feature Elimination with Random Forest was used to identify the final most dominant metabolomic biomarker at the second phase. Lastly, we ended with Ridge Classifier and XGBoost Classifier to assess the consistency of our approaches. Despite the declining number of metabolites up to a greater level, our prediction accuracy was 100% and 90.91% for Plasma and Serum samples, respectively which is higher than the state-of-the-art method.

It is also necessary to develop control and measuring materials that would have all the qualities (validity, reliability, consistency, significance and objectivity) to obtain the most reliable results in justifying the need and sufficiency of the identified conditions. The intensification of information processes in vocational education leads researchers to the need to find optimal conditions and tools to achieve pedagogical goals. Among these tools are machine learning methods and mathematical models built on their basis for quantitative assessment of the quality of vocational training in the field of environmental and economic activities. The use of the qualimetric approach in pedagogy is possible in the presence of a certain array of observational data for one or another criterion related to learning conditions, personal qualities of students, etc. The construction of an algorithmic model allows one to operate with conditions in mental experiments, test hypotheses, and since pedagogical research is quite long in time, the choice of conditions based on the most favorable forecast built using the model allows one to optimize pedagogical resources to achieve the planned results. Rational selection of effective control and measuring materials (CMMs) allows one to determine the need and sufficiency of organizational and pedagogical conditions. While mathematical modeling allows one to quickly adjust the organizational and pedagogical conditions as a set of opportunities for content, forms, teaching methods, information and communication technologies (ICTs) and CMMs used to achieve the planned educational results in the sphere of environmental and economic activity.

This paper presents a machine learning-based intelligent evaluation model for English composition.

The Word2Vec model is first trained with words, then used to generate a test model of word vectors, with the statistical information of the corresponding words in each category serving as content text features. The results show that when features based on word vector clustering are added to the content text, the effect of each model improves significantly, especially the maximum entropy model, which improves by 0.048. The XGBoost model has also seen a significant improvement, going from 0.771 to 0.803. The test corpus is made up of 100 articles chosen at random from the corpus, and the test set is checked for errors. The rate of accuracy is 68 percent.

This research aims to develop a method to integrate the Kano model and data mining approaches to select relevant attributes that drive customer satisfaction, with a specific focus on higher education. The significant contribution of this research is to solve the problem of selecting features that are not methodically correlated to customer satisfaction, which could reduce the risk of investing in features that could ultimately be irrelevant to enhancing customer satisfaction. Questionnaire data were collected from 646 students from UAE University. The experiment suggests that XGBoost Regression and Decision Tree Regression produce best results for this kind of problem. Based on the integration between the Kano model and the feature selection method, the number of features used to predict customer satisfaction is minimized to four features.

In this paper, a dropout prediction model based on multi-model stacking ensemble learning (MMSE) is proposed to further improve the accuracy of MOOC dropout prediction. The model mainly includes two parts: data preprocessing and model building. In the data preprocessing part, the student’s log records are used to design data features in weeks. In the model building part, a two-layer ensemble learning model is established. In the first layer, 5-fold cross-validation is used to train five different base classifiers.

As one of the most representative online social media, microblog contains a lot of public emotional information. The heterogeneity of microblog users' personal characteristics such as age, work and education leads to their different views, attitudes and values, making their views more representative and universal. Emotional analysis of these information is of great significance for us to understand the spread of public opinion events. By constructing a personal cognitive emotion classification model based on the optimized distributed gradient enhancement library, the emotion classification of microblog short text is realized. The model mainly includes text data collection and preprocessing, text feature extraction based on word embedding model word2vec, high fitting emotion classification model established through training corpus, and emotional tendency judgment according to the emotional tendency results obtained from the model. This paper takes 5 million microblog data and the data set released by CCF international natural language processing and Chinese Computing Conference as the word vector training corpus of word2vec to train the emotion classification model.   Research Objects and Methods In order to investigate the semantic analysis of emotion, we formed an open-ended questionnaire by consulting relevant literature, sorted out the recovered effective scales, and conducted data semantic analysis. On this basis, combined with the previous theoretical concepts, the preliminary measurement table of emotional information is compiled; Secondly, the preliminary test is carried out according to the items of the scale, and the data are analyzed through item analysis, exploratory factor analysis and reliability test of the scale; Finally, the formal scale is compiled, tested and recovered, and verified by confirmatory factor analysis and reliability and validity test. In order to test the relationship between emotional information and emotional regulation, the cognitive bias questionnaire (CBQ) was used to measure the negative cognitive bias assumed to be related to depression. The scale measures two dimensions: (1) depression and (2) cognitive distortion. “Depression” expressed by CBQ refers to depressive emotion, or bad mood, rather than a depressive syndrome containing all relevant symptoms. Cognitive distortion is defined as reasoning that is clearly incorrect in terms of known facts. CBQ attempts to evaluate the specific cognitive distortions proposed by Beck (19671970), such as over generalization, out of context, arbitrary and speculative reasoning and judgment, ignoring advantages or good results and exaggerating disadvantages or bad outcomes. The scale describes six situations common to college students or psychiatric patients, three for interpersonal relationships and three for self-achievement. After each situation, three or four questions are put forward. These questions represent four possible combinations of the two dimensions of depression and distortion: depression non distortion, depression distortion, non depression non distortion and non depression distortion. Subjects were asked to answer how they experienced when they were in this situation. The score is to compare the scores of the four combinations of depression and distortion respectively, and the score range is 0-23 points. At the same time, independent sample t-test and analysis of variance were carried out with college students' gender, grade, family location, major, one-child situation, student cadres, family status and parental education as independent variables. Whether it is a student cadre or not has a certain impact on the emotional regulation and self-efficacy of college students.   Results The improved model overcomes the shortcomings that the general methods can not explain the context and capture the semantic relationship of the context, and improves the efficiency and accuracy of emotion based classification. The effectiveness of different models can be evaluated according to confusion matrix or ROC curve. In this paper, the classification effect of xgboost emotion classification model is obviously better than that of SVM classification model.   Conclusion Our empirical results show that most netizens hold a negative attitude towards yumengyao wrestling competition. Due to its limitations, this paper only uses xgboost model to study the text emotion classification. In the future, deep neural network can more accurately understand the characteristics of microblog short text, realize higher precision emotion analysis, and help practitioners and decision makers comprehensively and effectively identify the public's views and attitudes towards national policies and current events. This paper is of great significance to the real-time public opinion analysis in the network social media environment, and emphasizes the necessity of promoting the establishment of network public opinion early warning mechanism.

However, few temporal prediction tools for adolescent four weight status have been developed. This study aimed to predict the short- and long-term weight status of Hong Kong adolescents and assess the importance of predictors.Methods A population-based retrospective cohort study of adolescents was conducted using data from a territory-wide voluntary annual health assessment service provided by the Department of Health in Hong Kong. Using diet habits, physical activity, psychological well-being, and demographics, we generated six prediction models for successive weight status (normal, overweight, obese and underweight) using multiclass Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbor, eXtreme gradient boosting, support vector machine, logistic regression. Model performance was evaluated by multiple standard classifier metrics and the overall accuracy. Predictors’ importance was assessed using Shapley values.Results 442,898 Primary 4 (P4, Grade 4 in the US) and 344,186 in Primary 6 (P6, Grade 6 in the US) students, with followed up until their Secondary 6 (Grade 12 in the US) during the academic years 1995/96 to 2014/15 were included. The XG Boosts model outperformed consistently all other models, predicting the long-term weight status at S6 from P4 or P6 with an overall accuracy of 0.89 or 0.90, respectively. XG Boost also achieved better model performance on each prediction window, and yielded obese group 0.96 precision, 0.98 recall, and 0.97 F-1 score both at S6 by P4 or P6. Weight, height, sex, age, frequency and hours of aerobic exercise were consistently the most important predictors for both cohorts.Conclusions The machine learning approaches accurately predict adolescent weight status in both short- and long-term. The developed multiclass model that utilizing easy-assessed variables enables accurate long-term prediction on weight status, which can be used by adolescents and parents for self-prediction when applied in health care system. The interpretable models may help to provide the early and individualized interventions suggestions for adolescents with weight problems particularly.",,,,,,,2023-05,2023,,,,,,All OA; Green,Article,"Liu, Hengyan; Wu, Yik-Chung; Chau, Pui Hing; Chung, Thomas Wai Hung; Fong, Daniel Yee Tak","Liu, Hengyan (); Wu, Yik-Chung (); Chau, Pui Hing (); Chung, Thomas Wai Hung (); Fong, Daniel Yee Tak ()",,"Liu, Hengyan (); Wu, Yik-Chung (); Chau, Pui Hing (); Chung, Thomas Wai Hung (); Fong, Daniel Yee Tak ()",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2937273/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1160449959,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3213 Paediatrics; 42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

With 901 participants selected by cluster sampling method, targeted short-answer questions text and participants’ social media post text (Weibo) were obtained while participants’ labels of proactive personality were evaluated by experts. In order to make classification, five machine learning algorithms included Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB) and Logistic Regression (LR) were deployed. Seven different indicators, which include Accuracy (ACC), F1-score (F1), Sensitivity (SEN), Specificity (SPE), Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV) and Area under Curve (AUC), combined with hierarchical cross-validation were also used to make the comprehensive evaluation of models. With participants’ Weibo text and short-answer questions text, we proposed a new approach to classify individuals’ proactive personality based on text mining technology. The results showed that short-answer questions + Weibo text datasets had the best performance, followed by short-answer questions text datasets, while the outcome of Weibo text datasets were the worst. However, it is noteworthy that Weibo text has the highest average score on the SPE, which indicated that Weibo text played an important role in identifying individuals with low proactive personality. With Weibo text, SEN was also improved compared with only applying short-answer questions text. In addition, among all three datasets, the indicator SPE is always higher than SEN, indicating this text classification approach was more competent for identifying college students with low proactive personality. As for algorithms, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression showed steadier performance compared with other algorithms.","This work was supported by the 13th Five-year Plan of Education Sciences of Shandong Province under Grant BZZK201901.

Behavior-based prediction of diagnostic success in a collaborative diagnostic reasoning simulation,"BackgroundMaking accurate diagnoses in teams requires complex collaborative diagnostic reasoning skills, which require extensive training. In this study, we investigated broad content-independent behavioral indicators of diagnostic accuracy and checked whether and how quickly diagnostic accuracy could be predicted from these behavioral indicators when they were displayed in a collaborative diagnostic reasoning simulation.MethodsA total of 73 medical students and 25 physicians were asked to diagnose patient cases in a medical training simulation with the help of an agent-based radiologist. Log files were automatically coded for collaborative diagnostic activities (CDAs; i.e., evidence generation, sharing and eliciting of evidence and hypotheses, drawing conclusions). These codes were transformed into bigrams that contained information about the time spent on and transitions between CDAs. Support vector machines with linear kernels, random forests, and gradient boosting machines were trained to classify whether a diagnostician could provide the correct diagnosis on the basis of the CDAs.ResultsAll algorithms performed well in predicting diagnostic accuracy in the training and testing phases. Yet, the random forest was selected as the final model because of its better performance (kappa = .40) in the testing phase. The model predicted diagnostic success with higher precision than it predicted diagnostic failure (sensitivity = .90; specificity = .46). A reliable prediction of diagnostic success  was possible after about two thirds of the median time spent on the diagnostic task. Most important for the prediction of diagnostic accuracy was the time spent on certain individual activities, such as evidence generation (typical for accurate diagnoses), and collaborative activities, such as sharing and eliciting evidence (typical for inaccurate diagnoses).ConclusionsThis study advances the understanding of differences in the collaborative diagnostic reasoning processes of successful and unsuccessful diagnosticians. Taking time to generate evidence at the beginning of the diagnostic task can help build an initial adequate representation of the diagnostic case that prestructures subsequent collaborative activities and is crucial for making accurate diagnoses. This information could be used to provide adaptive process-based feedback on whether learners are on the right diagnostic track. Moreover, early instructional support in a diagnostic training task might help diagnosticians improve such individual diagnostic activities and prepare for effective collaboration. In addition, the ability to identify successful diagnosticians even before task completion might help adjust task difficulty to learners in real time.",Not applicable.,"This work was supportet by a grant from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, FOR 2385) for a subproject conducted by the CoSiMed research group (FI 792/11-1).",Large-scale Assessments in Education,,,,2023-01-20,2023,2023-01-20,,11,1,3,All OA; Gold,Article,"Richters, Constanze; Stadler, Matthias; Radkowitsch, Anika; Schmidmaier, Ralf; Fischer, Martin R.; Fischer, Frank","Richters, Constanze (Department of Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany; Munich Center of the Learning Sciences (MCLS), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany); Stadler, Matthias (Department of Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany); Radkowitsch, Anika (Leibniz Institute for Science and Mathematics Education, Kiel, Germany); Schmidmaier, Ralf (Munich Center of the Learning Sciences (MCLS), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany; Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich, Germany); Fischer, Martin R.

391,pub.1149318283,10.28945/4997,,,Categorizing Well-Written Course Learning Outcomes Using Machine Learning,"Aim/Purpose: This paper presents a machine learning approach for analyzing Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs). The aim of this study is to find a model that can check whether a CLO is well written or not. Background: The use of machine learning algorithms has been, since many years, a prominent solution to predict learner performance in Outcome Based Education. However, the CLOs definition is still presenting a big handicap for faculties. There is a lack of supported tools and models that permit to predict whether a CLO is well written or not. Consequently, educators need an expert in quality and education to validate the outcomes of their courses. Methodology: A novel method named CLOCML (Course Learning Outcome Classification using Machine Learning) is proposed in this paper to develop predictive models for CLOs paraphrasing. A new dataset entitled CLOC (Course Learning Outcomes Classes) for that purpose has been collected and then undergone a pre-processing phase. We compared the performance of 4 models for predicting a CLO classification. Those models are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes and XGBoost. Contribution: The application of CLOCML may help faculties to make well-defined CLOs and then correct CLOs' measures in order to improve the quality of education addressed to their students. Findings: The best classification model was SVM. It was able to detect the CLO class with an accuracy of 83%. Recommendations for Practitioners: We would recommend both faculties’ members and quality reviewers to make an informed decision about the nature of a given course outcome. Recommendation for Researchers: We would highly endorse that the researchers apply more machine learning models for CLOs of various disciplines and compare between them. We would also recommend that future studies investigate on the importance of the definition of CLOs and its impact on the credibility of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) values during accreditation process. Impact on Society: The findings of this study confirm the results of several other researchers who use machine learning in outcome-based education. The definition of right CLOs will help the student to get an idea about the performances that will be measured at the end of a course. Moreover, each faculty can take appropriate actions and suggest suitable recommendations after right performance measures in order to improve the quality of his course. Future Research: Future research can be improved by using a larger dataset. It could also be improved with deep learning models to reach more accurate results. Indeed, a strategy for checking CLOs overlaps could be integrated.",,,Journal of Information Technology Education Innovations in Practice,,,,2022,2022,2022,,21,,061-075,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hadj Kacem, Yessine; Alshehri, Safa; Qaid, Tala","Hadj Kacem, Yessine (National engineering School of sfax); Alshehri, Safa (King Khalid University); Qaid, Tala (King Khalid University)",,"Hadj Kacem, Yessine (); Alshehri, Safa (King Khalid University); Qaid, Tala (King Khalid University)",0,0,,,http://www.jite.org/documents/Vol21/JITE-IIPv21p061-075Kacem8323.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149318283,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4611 Machine Learning,4 Quality Education
324,pub.1143362018,10.1182/blood-2021-151951,,,5hmC Gene Signature Predicts the Treatment Response to Azacitidine with High-Dose Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone in AML,"Abstract Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive disease with genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity that results in a highly variable response to standard chemotherapy. Azacitidine (AZA) is a hypomethylating agent (HMA) and has been investigated in combination with intensive chemotherapy as an epigenetic primer to sensitize leukemic cells to treatment. In a phase 1 trial, this regimen was safe and well-tolerated with overall response rate (CR+CRi) of 61% and complete remission rate of 41% (Cahill et al, Blood Adv 2020). Predictive biomarkers for response to this treatment strategy have not yet been identified. Since 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an epigenetic biomarker in cancer, we hypothesized that Nano-5hmC-Seal sequencing technology may serve as a novel approach to identifying 5hmC profiles predictive of treatment response to epigenetic priming. Methods We performed RNA-seq gene expression and Nano-5hmC-Seal DNA profiling from peripheral blood/bone marrow samples of patients with high-risk AML to identify potential 5hmC profile biomarkers and gene expression changes (Figure 1A). Patients (n=46) were treated in a 3+3 dose-escalation scheme of AZA (37.5 mg/m 2, 50 mg/m 2, or 75 mg/m 2) on days 1-5 followed by high-dose cytarabine (3000 mg/m 2) and mitoxantrone (30 mg/m 2) (AZA-HiDAC-Mito) on day 6 and day 10 in a phase 1 trial previously reported (Cahill et al, Blood Adv 2020). We compared pre-treatment RNA-seq gene expression and 5hmC DNA profiles between responders (CR+CRi) and non-responders, as well as between pre-treatment and after 5 days of AZA for individual patients. We used an XGBoost machine learning model in Python based on a training set of patients to develop a 5hmC gene signature to predict response to AZA-HiDAC-Mito in an independent test set of patients. We compared continuous variables with two-tailed Student's t-test and used the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test for survival analysis. Results Thirty-three patients (72%) had adequate RNA samples for RNA-seq gene expression analysis. Eighteen responded to treatment (CR +CRi) and were enriched with gene expression patterns involved in cell-cell interaction and activation of cell cycle, while non-responders (n=15) had a higher expression of leukemic stem cell (LSC) signatures. There was no difference in gene expression profile when comparing pre-treatment samples to day 5 samples after AZA exposure. From the 5hmC profiling [n=40 (87%) patients with adequate samples], increased 5hmC in LSC genes was associated with treatment resistance to AZA-HiDAC-Mito (p=0.044). The number of differentially hydroxy-methylated genes (DhMGs) increased with higher doses of AZA exposure suggesting a dose-dependent epigenetic effect from AZA. Patients with a greater number of DhMGs following 5 days of AZA treatment had improved survival (p=0.015) (Figure 1B). Using the 5hmC-based XGBoost machine learning model comparing 5hmC profiles between responders to non-responders from a training set of patients (n=22), we developed an 11-gene 5hmC pre-treatment signature (including SKP1, WNT8A, CYP2E1, and NBPF9) to predict treatment response. The model was highly effective in predicting response to therapy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 in an independent test set of patients (n=18) treated with AZA-HiDAC-Mito (Figure 1C). Conclusion In patients with AML treated with AZA-HiDAC-Mito, a pre-treatment LSC gene expression signature enriched with 5hmC was associated with treatment resistance. More DhMGs at day 5 appear to be a dose-dependent epigenetic effect that is induced by AZA and is associated with longer survival despite the absence of an immediate change in gene expression levels. An 11-gene 5hmC pre-treatment signature may be a predictive biomarker for AZA-HiDAC-Mito therapy and other HMA-based approaches. These findings warrant validation in a larger prospective trial.

311,pub.1160062261,10.1093/humrep/dead093.108,,,P-544 Biochemical markers as a predictor of clinical pregnancy on day 6 after embryo transfer,"Abstract  Study question Is it possible to predict clinical pregnancy using Machine Learning models on day 6 after embryo transfer to an acceptable degree of certainty?   Summary answer Using selected biochemical markers it is possible to build a machine learning model to predict clinical pregnancy.   What is known already Human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) is considered the main early predictor of pregnancy. Due to the fact that the highest percentage of spontaneous abortions occurs in the first trimester predicting clinical pregnancy outcomes at the early stages of pregnancy is particularly difficult. The level of B-hcg measured at the early stages of implantation and the dynamics of its increase can help predict clinical pregnancy and predict its further development. However, the specific cut-off points at which pregnancy can be determined vary from study to study, and a different factor is often suggested to increase the certainty of β-hCG-based predictions.   Study design, size, duration 1474 single frozen embryo transfers (1205 patients between 23 and 47 years of age), January 2019 -December 2022 were used for data modelling and statistical testing. The dataset consisted of endocrinal markers:β-hCG, PRG (progesterone), E (estradiol) measured on the 6th day after ET and other practitioner-chosen data: age, PGD results, embryo quality status, RIF or RPL history, embryo maturation days as well as pregnancy outcomes. Exclusion criteria were: PRG > 50ng/ml, β-hCG >70 mIU/ml.   Participants/materials, setting, methods A machine learning model for predicting clinical pregnancy was trained using the gradient boosting technique. The model used 100 decision trees with 8 leaves, maximal depth of 2 nodes and a learning rate of 0.1. The performance of the model was measured using the accuracy score metric and area under ROC (AUC). Feature importance was based on Shapley values. Additional analysis was performed using statistical testing using a two-sided Student’s t-test.   Main results and the role of chance A Machine Learning naive model employed chosen variables to predict clinical pregnancy. The most important variables turned out to be the serum level of β-hCG and PRG on day 6 after embryo-transfer. The final model, limited to those variables, performs with an accuracy of around 83 % (accuracy score = 0.834), the area under ROC (AUC) was 0.927. Based on Shapley values, β-hCG followed by PRG are the most relevant for the model’s predictions. Low PRG concentrations increased the chances of clinical pregnancy. The findings were confirmed by additional statistical analysis. Observations were divided into two groups for which the cut-off point was the level of PRG of 24 ng/ml – the median for the whole group. The probability of clinical pregnancy is higher in the group where the serum PRG is below 24 ng/ml even if β-hCG levels are the same. A statistically significant difference between these groups regarding β-hCG (P value < 0.001) was noticed. In order for serum β-hCG to be used as a more accurate clinical pregnancy predictor its level should be interpreted in the context of PRG serum levels.   Limitations, reasons for caution Since in the dataset, only data regarding frozen embryo transfers were included, fresh ETs need to be explored further. The model was based on endocrinal markers as measured on day six after ET hence it cannot be used to interpret those markers as measured on any other date.   Wider implications of the findings In order to most accurately inform patients regarding the possible outcomes of embryo-transfers, practitioners should not limit themselves to monitoring β-hCG serum levels but also include PRG as an important prognostic of clinical pregnancy.

Materials and Method: Breast cancer patients, who had MRI exam of the breast in our institution at the time of staging for breast carcinoma and who subsequently had surgery (segmentectomy or mastectomy) from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2015 were identified. All lesions were evaluated by radiologists in accordance with the BI-RADS lexicon. The patient's age, breast cancer histology, multifocality/multicentricity (MF/MC), lesion size, axillary lymphadenopathy (LAN), MRI morphologic and enhancement characteristics were documented. Quantitative MRI feature analysis was performed using shape, texture, and histogram based features. Machine-learning-based (Xgboost) models were used to predict subtypes, and Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to avoid model overfitting. Statistical significance was determined using the Student's t-test. Results: Total of 105 patients, 51 patients with TN and 54 patients with HER2+ breast cancer were included in analysis. Mean age for TN was 50 (range 29-79)) years old and for HER2+ was 49 (range 25-70) years old. Axillary LAN and MF/MC disease was seen more commonly in HER2+ patients when compared to TN patients, but didn't reach statistical significance (13 vs 7, p=0.9; and 31 vs 20, p=0.06, respectively). Mass rim enhancement was associated with TN subtype and irregular mass enhancement was associated with HER2+ subtype of breast cancer (p<0.05). Quantitative analysis showed that six out of the top 10 ranked MRI features: surface to volume ratio, difference variance, difference entropy, inverse difference moment, 75 percentile in histogram and sum average, were significantly different between these 2 subtypes with p<0.05. When the significant features were incorporated to distinguish TN and HER+ subtypes, use of the top 2 features achieved the best accuracy on LOOCV of 0.69. Conclusion: The quantitative MRI features show promise in distinguishing TN and HER2+ breast cancer subtypes reflecting their underlying biological characteristics and may be used as predictive quantitative biological markers. Further studies in a larger cohort evaluating associations with treatment response are underway.
